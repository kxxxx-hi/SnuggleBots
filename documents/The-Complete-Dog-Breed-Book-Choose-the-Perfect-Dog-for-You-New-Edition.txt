INTRODUCTION TO DOGS

WHAT IS A DOG?
The evolution of the dog from wild predator to domestic companion has been greatly influenced by human intervention. It has taken just a few hundred years to produce seemingly endless variations on the canine theme – but planned breeding has not removed the basic characteristics of the dog’s ancestor, the wolf.

Evolution of the dog
All dogs share a common ancestor: the grey wolf. While this relationship is fairly apparent in breeds such as the
German Shepherd or Spitz-type dogs, with their wolf-like heads and pricked ears, it is hard to see the connection between wolves and Toy Poodles or St. Bernards. Genetically,
however, any dog of any breed is virtually identical to the wolf. The transition from wolf to the huge diversity of domestic dogs known today happened relatively quickly. The process began gradually, with random changes in size and shape, but accelerated when humans began to selectively breed those dogs that exhibited characteristics they desired.

In from the wild
Grey wolves and dogs diverged between 15,000 to 40,000
years ago, but when and where they developed a close relationship with humans is unclear. DNA evidence for

Dogs are social animals

domesticated dogs has been found in several locations in
Asia and Europe; the timing varies from 20,000 to 40,000
years ago, which suggests that domestication events may have occurred more than once, and in different areas. The oldest remains known to be domesticated dogs date back to around 14,000 years ago, and comprise human-dog burials from the Middle East and Germany. Older dog fossils from
Europe and Asia also exist, but whether these are fossils of domesticated dogs remains uncertain.
There are alternative theories about how dogs became domesticated. Some scholars believe that wolves scavenging around early human encampments were killed for their meat and skin; their orphan pups were taken in and reared in captivity, and were found to be valuable as hunters and protectors, beginning the process of domestication. Others question why humans would want to domesticate a large predator that would compete with them for food. They suggest

Even with the use of genetic analysis, unravelling the history of a particular breed is not easy. Some breeds are commonly said to be very ancient, but genetic evidence suggests that the majority are, in fact, modern re-creations. With few exceptions, most breeds known today were developed no earlier than the 19th century.

that wolves were more trusting of humans, and could learn and adapt to human behaviour, and so in part may have domesticated themselves.
Over subsequent generations, this led to physical developments such as drop ears, and behavioural changes, such as increased friendliness, to encourage humans to fulfil their needs.
Hundreds of years passed before deliberate breeding became more sophisticated, selecting for coat type, colour,
temperament, and specialized skills, eventually creating hundreds of different breeds. The selection processes have altered over the years, and while certain characteristics fall out of favour, others become embedded in the breed standard.

Information from dog DNA
In the past, the history of a dog breed was pieced together from written records, pictures, and information handed down from past breeders and owners. Today, the analysis of DNA (the hereditary template found in body cells) has also made it possible to track the inheritance of features such as size and coat colour, and to look at the differences and similarities between one breed and another. Most importantly, looking at DNA has made it possible to identify which breeds are at risk of specific genetic diseases and conditions (see pp.338–39). Scientists sequenced the first complete dog genome (the complete set of genetic information possessed by an organism) in 2005 using the DNA of a Boxer.
PACK MENTALITY
Doing things cooperatively is an inbuilt canine characteristic, but domestic dogs now look to humans,
rather than other dogs, when they need help.

Dog anatomy
The physical characteristics of a dog are typical of a predator whose survival relies on efficiency in locating and catching prey. Humans have done much to adapt canine design,
but the basic anatomy of all breeds of dog is the same.
The skeleton of the dog evolved to provide speed,
strength, and manoeuvrability. A highly flexible spine and freely moving forelimbs allow a dog to move with a long,
swinging stride. The most important characteristics of a dog’s skeleton are seen in the legs. The two large forearm bones, the radius and the ulna, are locked together in such a way that a dog can make rapid changes of direction without the bones rotating and breaking. In a further adaptation, two of the wrist bones are fused together –
unlike the separate bones seen in humans – to give a dog strength and stability when moving in a straight line.
Combined with long, powerful toes, with claws like studs on running shoes, this limb arrangement gives a dog a high degree of control whether it is running, jumping, or turning.
Classified as carnivores, dogs are anatomically adapted to eat primarily meat, although, given the opportunity,
domestic dogs will eat almost anything. A dog’s teeth are designed to deal with tough foods such as hide, flesh, and

bone. Four large canine teeth at the front of a dog’s mouth are used for grabbing and biting prey, while the sides of the jaw include specially modified teeth, the carnassials, which the dog uses for shearing off meat. Dogs have a capacious stomach for the storage of large quantities of food and, as meat can be digested rapidly, a short intestinal tract.
Dogs have a wide-angled field of vision that functions best at long distance and they are extremely sensitive to movement. Out of the corner of an eye, a dog can pick up the flicker of a rabbit a hundred metres away, but at close range,
canine vision is less efficient, which is why a dog may fail to spot a toy on the ground in front of his nose. Dogs have little use for sophisticated colour vision and their eyes have far fewer colour-receptive cells than those of humans.
Sharp hearing and the ability to pinpoint the direction of sounds is essential to wild hunting dogs. Breeds with erect ears shaped like those of the wolf are likely to have more acute hearing than breeds with drop ears, which rely more on sight or scent when hunting. A dog’s highly sensitive ears allow it to pick up sounds at a far higher frequency than can be heard by humans. Smell is the most important of all canine senses. Sniffing is the way a dog

reads its surroundings and the area of the brain that interprets smells is around 40 times larger than the corresponding area in a human brain. Dogs’ noses are packed with far more scent receptive cells than humans:
while a person has an estimated
5 million scent receptors, a small dog may have closer to
130 million. In breeds renowned for their scenting ability,
such as hounds, the number of scent receptors may be as many as 200–300 million.
Unlike humans, dogs do not have sweat glands in their skin, except on the bottoms of their paws. To cool down,
dogs must pant, tongue hanging out. The tongue produces copious saliva, some of which evaporates and so helps to reduce body temperature.

Head shapes
All canine heads are variations of three basic shapes. The majority of dogs have a mesaticephalic head, in which length and width are of medium proportions. A dolichocephalic head is long and narrow, with a barely noticeable stop. Brachycephalic heads are broad based and short in length.

Ear types
Pricked, sensitive, wolf-like ears – the original canine shape – occur in many breeds of dog, but centuries of planned selection have created a large variety of other ear shapes. There are three main types: erect, semi-erect, and drop. Within these categories are many variations, such as the type of erect ear known as candle flame. Ear types are often the defining characteristic of a dog group; for example, scent hounds usually have long, pendant ears. Ears strongly influence a dog’s overall appearance. The correct set, shape,
and carriage of the ears are considered very important in recognized breeds,
and are described precisely in official breed standards.

Coat varieties
The majority of dog breeds have a double coat like their wolf ancestor.
This usually consists of an insulating layer of soft, dense hair covered by a harsher outer coat of varying length and texture. A few thinner-coated breeds, such as greyhounds, have just a single layer of hair (no undercoat). In some breeds, chance genetic mutation has produced dogs that are either completely hairless or have just a few strands of hair on the head and legs.

INTRODUCTION TO DOGS

Breeds and breed groups
Although many distinct varieties of dog were recognized earlier, until the early 20th century their breeding was not necessarily strictly controlled. When dog breeders started to cooperate with one another and form clubs they were able to produce dogs of consistent type. This led to the writing of breed standards that describe the ideal appearance
(with permissible variations) and temperament of a breed,
and its suitability for function. Dogs were also registered in stud books to enable their pedigrees to be reviewed for future breeding.
Despite the detailed dog breed standards that exist, there are as yet no universally recognized criteria for classifying dog breeds in groups. The main regulatory bodies are the
Kennel Club (KC) in the UK; the Fédération Cynologique
Internationale (FCI) — the World Canine Organization, which includes 86 member countries; and the American Kennel
Club (AKC). These all group breeds together based loosely

on function, but no two systems are exactly the same. Both the UK and American Kennel Clubs recognize seven groups,
while the FCI has ten. The number of individual breeds recognized by these organizations also varies.
This book places breeds together in eight major groups:
primitive dogs; working dogs; spitz-type dogs; sight hounds;
scent hounds; terriers; gundogs; and companion dogs; plus a section on crossbreeds and random bred dogs. The groupings of the so-called primitive dogs, sight hounds, and the spitz-type dogs in this book have been made on the basis of well-established genetic relationships. In some cases, this results in a breed appearing in a different group from the one that might be expected. The Basenji, for example, is often grouped functionally with hounds but genetic evidence places it among the primitive breeds, which is where this book, and the FCI, place it. For the remainder of the groups,
more traditional, functional groupings are used.

INTRODUCTION TO DOGS

CHOOSING THE RIGHT DOG
A puppy can grow into a big dog,
so know what you are buying

The dog you choose will probably be your companion for the next 10 or 12 years, so making the right decision is important.
Being faced with more than 400 different breeds with a variety of exercise, training, and grooming needs can be bewildering.
This section provides advice and flowcharts to help you narrow down your choice.

The perfect match
You may be attracted to a particular breed because of its looks, or have fallen in love with a beguiling puppy, but before going any further consider carefully whether you and the dog are a good match. To avoid difficulties and disappointments later on, take a look at your lifestyle and ask yourself the following questions.
What type of home do you live in, and are you a town or country dweller? A small apartment is obviously no place for a very large breed if both owner and dog are to cohabit comfortably. Remember, though, that a small dog with exceptionally high energy levels can also seem to take up a lot of room. Whether or not you have a garden, you will need access to open spaces where your dog can safely let off steam and meet other dogs. How house-proud are you?
Can you tolerate loose hairs, slobber, and muddy pawprints?
Keeping the place tidy can be harder with a dog around.
Can you give a dog the exercise he needs to stay physically and mentally fit? Some owners want an undemanding companion who is content with a short daily walk followed by a long snooze. If you enjoy an active lifestyle yourself,
you may want a lively running mate to help set the pace for jogging or on long hikes. Large dogs do not necessarily need

more exercise than small ones. Some of the bigger breeds have a very laid-back attitude to life, while many small dogs,
such as terriers, have boundless energy.
How much effort are you willing to put into grooming your dog? Long-coated breeds look beautiful but they are high maintenance and may need daily brushing and detangling.
You should also consider the likely cost of professional grooming: some dogs have coats that are easy to care for in day-to-day terms but may need regular trimming.
Is your dog to be part of a family that includes children or other pets? Be wary of picking a breed that is large or exuberant enough to knock over a small child or an older person, or a dog with a natural chasing instinct that might put a beloved cat or guinea pig at risk.
Do you have enough room in your life for a dog? Exercise will take up time every day, but what dogs need as much as walks is company; any dog left alone for too long is likely to become bored, morose, and destructive. If you work away from the house all week, then unless you can make adequate care arrangements, a dog may not be a suitable pet for you.
Owning a dog is a long-term commitment in financial and practical terms. Make it a joy by choosing the breed that is as near as possible the perfect one for you.

HOW TO USE THE FLOWCHARTS
The following flowcharts will help you to choose a dog. They are based on three criteria: exercise,
grooming, and training. Decide if you want a dog with high,
medium, or low exercise requirements, and follow the paths to find suggestions for suitable breeds. Also look at the breed catalogue data to find further dogs not listed here.

INTRODUCTION TO DOGS

Finding a breeder
If you decide to buy a pedigree dog, you need to find a reputable breeder. A recommendation from your vet or a friend is ideal, and some kennel clubs provide lists of breeders; otherwise, the best way to choose a breeder is to visit several armed with a list of questions (see box opposite for the most important ones to ask).
Good breeders will be happy to give you plenty of time to observe the litter. It is particularly important to see puppies with their litter mates and their mother.
Young puppies should never be kept in isolation, and if this is the case at any kennels you visit, then do not consider buying from them. The sire may not be at the same breeders, but if he is, ask if you can see him too.
The appearance, behaviour, and temperament of the adult dogs will enable you to make a judgement on the likely future development of your puppy.
Watch how the puppies interact with each other and with people. Some puppies are boisterous and outgoing from the start, showing no reservations about approaching strangers,
while others hang back from rough play and are nervous or shy. A confident puppy is usually a good choice, but a quieter dog may appeal to you more. However, check that a seemingly subdued puppy does not have health problems and is failing to thrive.
Expect breeders to ask you some questions too. They will want to know what sort of home and lifestyle you are offering, whether you are an experienced or a first-time

PICK OF THE LITTER
Even very young puppies have distinct personalities. Whether you favour a shy one or the boss of the litter, make sure that he has bright eyes, a clean coat, and appears used to a home environment.

owner, and if you are fully aware of the time and cost that keeping a dog entails. Do some homework before you pay your visit, and be honest with your answers.
A breeder should be able to supply vet’s references and provide other credentials such as membership of a breed association. Also find out if your chosen breeder offers
“after-sales” service, such as advice on feeding or health.
Once you have come to an agreement, expect to collect your new puppy when he is about eight weeks of age.

Puppy farms
Never buy a dog from one of the many so-called “puppy farms”. Such establishments are usually little more than canine battery farms, where dogs are kept in inhumane conditions, bred to exhaustion, and given little or nothing in the way of health care. Avoid buying from petshops too,
as the puppies they sell do not usually have a history and may come from puppy farms. Also beware of advertisements offering a selection of different breeds, as these are often placed by dealers who trade in farmed puppies.

Buying a rescue dog

FAMILY GROUP
Never consider buying a puppy unless you can see the litter with their mother. No reputable breeder will keep young puppies in separate accommodation.

Unless you are set on buying a young puppy from a recognized breeder, you may find just what you want at a dog rescue centre. These centres occasionally have litters of puppies but in most cases their dogs are either fully mature or at least a few months old. Many rescue dogs are of mixed breeding, although some purebreds do turn up.
If you prefer a pedigree dog, you could also try one of the numerous rescue societies that specialize in rehousing particular breeds, such as greyhounds.
Not all rescue dogs come from a background of neglect or cruelty. Some need rehousing because of an owner’s death or change in family circumstances. However, many have an unknown or traumatic history, and may display behavioural

CHOOSING THE RIGHT DOG

problems and anxieties that can be difficult to overcome.
Think carefully before being tempted to take on such a dog in the hope of rehabilitating him, as you could end up with more than you bargained for. A good, loving home goes a long way, but traumatized dogs need experienced handling, an above-average amount of patience, and possibly professional retraining. Most rescue centres will offer you back-up advice and support.
When buying a dog from a rescue home, use the same approach as you would if buying from a breeder. Observe the dogs closely and ask, and expect to be asked, questions.
Rescue homes screen prospective owners very carefully and will probably want to visit your home.
MAKING A GOOD MATCH
Adopting a rescue dog is a two-way process. While you are deciding which dog you want, a good rescue centre will assess your suitability as an owner. It will want to know as much as possible about you, your home, and your family.

10 IMPORTANT QUESTIONS TO ASK A BREEDER
• Will the puppy have received his first vaccinations and been wormed before I collect him?
• Are your dogs screened for inherited diseases, and may I take a look at the screening certificates?
• Can you provide a written guarantee of the puppy’s health?
• Will you provide a written contract of sale and does it specify what I should do if I can no longer care for my puppy?
• Can you provide references from, for example, a vet or previous customers?
• Have you registered the puppy with a kennel club?
• Can you provide a printed pedigree for the puppy?
• What do you consider the most important characteristics of this breed?
• How long have you been working with this breed?
• Have your puppies been well socialized in your home as well as in the outside environment?

Elegant and immaculate, the

PRIMITIVE DOGS

Most modern dog breeds are the result of many years of selective breeding for particular characteristics, but a few,
commonly regarded as primitive dogs, have remained close to the original “blueprint” of their wolf ancestors. As a group,
primitive dogs are not clearly defined, and not all authorities agree that such a category should be recognized.

As variously listed, primitive dogs are a diverse group but many of them share typically wolf-like characteristics. These include erect ears, a wedge-shaped head with a pointed muzzle, and a tendency to howl rather than bark.
Their coats are usually short but vary in colour and density according to the region from which the dog originates. Most primitive dogs come into season only once a year, unlike other domestic dogs, which have two cycles of oestrus a year.
Canine specialists are now taking an interest in dogs that have had little to do with humans and nothing to do with breed development programmes.
These primitive dogs, which come from various parts of the world, include the
Carolina Dog of North America and the rare New Guinea Singing Dog,
which is genetically close to the dingo of Australia. Such dogs have evolved naturally rather than through breeding

for temperament or appearance and cannot be considered completely domesticated. The New Guinea Singing
Dog, which is highly endangered in the wild, is more likely to be seen in zoos than in homes.
Several dogs are included in the primitive group because they are believed to be uninfluenced by any other types over thousands of years. Among them is the Basenji from Africa,
long used for hunting in its native country before becoming a popular pet. Other examples are hairless dogs from Mexico and South America, genetic mutations of coated breeds, which resemble dogs depicted in the art and artefacts of ancient civilizations.
Recent genetic investigations suggest that two dogs included in this section – the Pharaoh Hound and the
Ibizan Hound – should no longer be considered primitive. These breeds are popularly supposed to be the direct descendants of big-eared
Egyptian hounds pictured in drawings dating back 5,000 years. However,
there is genetic evidence that the line
STILL WILD
The dingo-like New Guinea Singing Dog does not adapt well to domestic life. It may have inhabited New Guinea from prehistoric times.

Hairless dogs are depicted in ancient Pre-Incan artefacts

of descent may not have remained unbroken down the centuries. It is probable that the Pharaoh and Ibizan
Hounds are in fact modern recreations of a primitive dog type.

The Aztecs believed that hairless dogs were sent by the gods and had magical properties.

In pre-Conquest Mexico hairless dogs were believed to have sacred significance and were often used as a sacrifice or ritually eaten in religious ceremonies. Because of these practices, hairless dogs barely escaped extinction and it was not until the mid-20th century that breeders began to work towards its recovery. Three different sizes are now recognized. Like all hairless dogs, this breed has limited general appeal and remains something of a rarity. Nonetheless, the
Xoloitzcuintle, also known as the Mexican Hairless, is charming,
good-tempered, and intelligent, and is likely to reward its owner with loyalty and affection.

RESCUE WORK

WORKING DOGS

The list of jobs that humans ask dogs to perform is almost endless. In the thousands of years since dogs were domesticated,
canine helpers have guarded homes, rescued people in danger,
gone to war, and looked after the sick and disabled — to give only a few examples. In this book the working group is represented by breeds traditionally developed for pastoral work and guard duties.

In general, the dogs in this highly diverse group tend to be large, though there are a few small but nonetheless robust exceptions. Working dogs are bred for strength and stamina, and many of them are capable of living outdoors in all weathers.
A collie rounding up its flock is for most people the archetypal shepherd dog, but many other types of dog are used to work with livestock. These pastoral breeds, as they are known,
are used for both herding and guarding.
Herding dogs have a natural instinct for driving stock, though not all of them work in the same way. Border Collies,
for example, keep their sheep in order by stalking and staring, while the traditional cattle-herders such as Welsh
Corgis and the Australian Cattle Dog nip at heels, and some herders bark as they work. Guardian sheepdogs, which include mountain breeds such as the

Maremma and Pyrenean Mountain Dog,
are designed to protect their flocks from predators such as wolves. Usually very large, many of these dogs are white and heavy-coated, scarcely distinguishable from the sheep they spend their lives guarding.
Guard duties of another kind are often carried out by dogs of the mastiff type,
recognizable as descendants of the enormous Molossus dogs seen in friezes and artefacts from the ancient world. Such breeds as the Bullmastiff,
the Dogue de Bordeaux, and the
Neapolitan Mastiff are used worldwide by security forces and for guarding property. Typically, these dogs are massively built and powerful,
with small ears (often cropped in countries where the practice is still legal) and pendulous lips.
Many working breeds are excellent as companion dogs.
Pastoral herders are extremely intelligent and generally easy to train, and often enjoy using their skills in agility trials and other canine competitions.
Livestock guardian dogs,
because of their sheer size and protective nature, are less likely
AGILITY TRIALS
Border Collies are often seen displaying their agility and intelligence at working dog trials.

Shepherd dogs work as herders and guardians

to be suited to family life. In recent decades a number of the mastiff-type breeds have achieved great popularity as companions. Although some were produced originally for fighting, if reared in the home and socialized early they can adapt to life as a pet.
LIVESTOCK GUARDIANS
The protective instincts of breeds such as the Hungarian Kuvasz make these dogs unsuitable for the inexperienced owner.

This rich-coated breed, a descendant of the rather less-refined Scottish working shepherd dogs, is much admired today as a pet and in the show ring. The Rough Collie’s history may go back as far as Roman Britain,
but dogs recognizably of this type did not attract wide attention until the 19th century.
Queen Victoria is credited with popularizing the breed both in Europe and the United
States. Later, “Lassie”, the highly intelligent star of film and television, confirmed the
Rough Collie’s status as one of the bestloved dogs of all time.
This breed is mild-tempered and tolerant of other dogs and pets. It is highly responsive to training and makes an affectionate and protective companion. However, the peopleloving Rough Collie readily accepts visitors to the home and therefore does not make a good guard dog. An athletic breed, it is eager for fun and will take part with brio in canine sports such as agility trials.

The herding instinct has not been entirely bred out of Rough Collies; their sharp awareness of movement may trigger an impulse to “round up” friends and family. Early socializing can prevent this trait from becoming a nuisance.
Like all breeds originally intended as working dogs, the Rough Collie becomes restless when under-exercised or left alone for long periods, and may start to bark excessively. However, given an energetic daily run, it can be kept in a modestly sized house or large apartment.
This dog’s long, thick coat needs regular grooming to prevent tangles and matting. More frequent grooming sessions may be needed when the dense undercoat is being shed,
which occurs twice a year.

The Border Collie’s reputation for intelligence reaches far beyond the borderland counties of the UK where it originated. Its excellence as a working sheepdog is legendary, and watching it in action at competitive events has become a popular spectator sport. Tireless energy, low boredom threshold, and an independent spirit make it an unsuitable pet for owners with restricted space or a sedentary lifestyle. However, this dog is highly responsive to experienced handling, and will reward commitment to training by becoming a faithful and obedient companion. The

The two breeds of Welsh Corgi have a long history as cattle-herders and guard dogs in Wales. The more widely known of the two breeds, the
Pembroke Welsh Corgi, is distinguishable from the Cardigan Welsh Corgi
(see p.55) by its slightly smaller ears and shorter tail. This alert and energetic little dog makes an excellent watchdog and enjoys family life. Their tendency to occasionally revert to their herding instincts and nip ankles can be minimized by early training. Pembroke
Welsh Corgis tend to put on weight easily, so need a well-regulated regime of diet and exercise.

In the mountainous Carpathian region of Romania,
shepherds rely on large, robust dogs to guard their flocks in all weathers. Regional breeding has resulted in several distinct types: the
Carpatin, the Bucovina, and the Mioritic.
All are better suited to outdoor rather than indoor life, and none is widely known as a companion dog. With strong watchdog instincts, Romanian Shepherd Dogs are highly territorial and suspicious of strangers. They need plenty of physical and mental activity, as well as early socialization and firm training.

The early uses of this native Chinese breed included herding and guarding livestock, hunting, and fighting. However, the Shar Pei’s amiable nature and relatively compact size make it suitable as a pet for a town or country home. The dog’s distinctive appearance has huge popular appeal and,
at least for a while, owning a Shar Pei was a fashion statement.
Some breeders sought to increase the Shar Pei’s wrinkly looks by producing dogs with excessively loose and folded facial skin. However, this resulted in eye problems, and the practice is now largely discredited.

By the early 19th century such dogs were almost extinct, but dedicated breeding over the next 200 years regenerated the type and produced the Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog. This dog is still rare and not widely known outside the United States.
Muscular and intrepid, an Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog has strong protective instincts, but it is easy to train to be a well-behaved and affectionate companion. Energetic outdoors, this dog is happiest when given plenty of exercise.

Once a Boxer-owner, always a Boxer-owner
– this German breed is so big on personality that few who live with it ever look at another type of dog. The Boxer in its modern form was developed in the 19th century and its ancestry is thought to include mastiff-type dogs such as the Bulldog (see p.94) and the
Great Dane (see p.95). Powerful and athletic,
it was bred primarily for fighting and bullbaiting, but was also used for farm work,
haulage, and for hunting and holding down large game such as wild boar. Because of its endurance and courage, the breed is used today as a police and military searchand-rescue dog and for guard work.
The Boxer’s history, its proud, upstanding attitude, and forward-thrusting jaw give the impression of an intimidating dog, and it can certainly be protective of home and family,
but it makes a wonderful companion. It is

loyal, affectionate, endearingly attentionseeking, and a boisterous but tolerant friend for children. This energetic breed suits fit,
active owners as it retains its high spirits and playfulness into late maturity. Almost any sort of fun keeps a Boxer happy but, ideally,
it requires a good two-hour walk every day with plenty of scope for romping around in the open. At home, given its stamina and curiosity, a Boxer enjoys a large garden where it has space to roam and interesting corners to explore.
This highly intelligent dog can be a handful to train but is obedient provided it receives calm and consistent commands and clear leadership. With early socializing, a Boxer is likely to get on well with any other pets in the family, although out on walks its hunting instincts may be aroused if there are birds or small animals to chase.

SPITZ-TYPE DOGS
A team of huskies pulling a sled over icy wastelands epitomizes the type of dog known as a Spitz. In fact, this group has diverse uses, including herding, hunting, and guarding; many smaller types are kept solely as pets. Descent from wolves is apparent in many spitz dogs: the shape of the head, the typical wolf colouring, and an alert expression.

Many of the modern spitz breeds seen today originated in northern Arctic regions, though a number of them,
including the Chow Chow and Akita,
were developed in East Asia. The history of the spitz group remains unclear, but it is currently thought that they originated in Asia, some migrating alongside tribal movements into Africa and others across the
Bering Strait to North America.
Breeds such as the Greenland Dog and Siberian Husky were used most famously for sled-hauling by the polar explorers of the 19th and early 20th centuries. These tough dogs worked in appalling weather conditions, often on a diet of poor food, and frequently ended up being eaten themselves when their owners ran out of rations. Such spitz-type sled dogs were also once widely used by North American hunters and fur-trappers. Today, the sled-hauling spitz breeds are popular for endurance

racing and with tourists who want to try their hand at dog-driving. Other spitz dogs have been bred for hunting large game, such as wolf and bear, and for herding reindeer. The Akita,
originally from Japan, was developed as a fighter and bear-hunter and now often works as a guard dog. Among the small, non-working spitz dogs are the
Pomeranian, selectively bred down in size from a larger type of dog, and the newly created Alaskan Klee Kai,
a miniature husky.
Spitz dogs, both large and small,
have the characteristics of animals bred specifically for living in extremely cold climates. Typically,
they have a very thick double coat, which varies in length and density according to the origin of a breed. Other features for preventing heat loss in low temperatures are pointed, denselyfurred ears, and well-furred feet. An attractive addition to many breeds is

EX-FIGHTER
The burly Akita was once a fighting dog in its native

the distinctive “spitz” tail that curls upwards over the back.
As house dogs, most spitz breeds are happy with family life, but they are not the easiest of dogs to train.
Without sufficient exercise and amusement they can resort to disruptive behaviour such as digging holes and barking.
SMALLEST SPITZ
The tiny Pomeranian is the smallest of the spitz-type breeds. Although it was bred as a pet, this dog has a strong character and is full of indomitable spitz spirit.

ALASKAN MALAMUTE

Heavily muscled thighs

A LARGE, SLED-PULLING DOG THAT CAN ADAPT WELL TO FAMILY LIFE

The wolf-like Alaskan Malamute is named after the Native American Mahlemut people,
who bred these dogs to pull heavy loads and travel great distances across the snow when sleds were the only mode of transport. Today,
it is still used to haul freight in remote North
American locations, and successfully takes part in sled-racing competitions. Also used on polar expeditions, this breed has staggering amounts of stamina, strength, and tenacity combined with highly tuned senses of direction and smell.
For all its toughness, the Alaskan Malamute is a friendly dog, at least towards people,
which means that it cannot be relied on as a guard dog. It likes children but is too big and boisterous to be left alone with a small child.
The Alaskan Malamute, especially the male,
tends to be intolerant of strange dogs, and without thorough socializing can quickly

become aggressive. The breed also has a strong chasing instinct and can disappear far and fast in pursuit of small animals that it sees as prey. Owners should be cautious about where and when to exercise this dog off the lead. A quick learner, the Alaskan
Malamute has a strong will, so needs firm handling and training in good habits right from the start.
The Alaskan Malamute settles well into domestic life as long as it has at least two hours of exercise each day and a garden to roam in. A bored dog, with energy to spare,
can be destructive if left at home without supervision. Although its thick coat sheds in spring, there is a risk of overheating if the dog is over-exercised in hot weather,
so it needs access to shade. The hardy
Alaskan Malamute is happy to sleep outdoors, provided it has a companion.

Origin Russia

Developed centuries ago by the nomadic
Samoyed people of Siberia, this beautiful dog was used for herding and guarding reindeer and for sled-hauling. This tough,
outdoor worker was also very much a family dog, taking its place in its owner’s tent and enjoying human companionship. These dogs were brought to England in the 1800s and were first seen in the United States around a decade later. Numerous myths and unsubstantiated stories link the Samoyeds to the polar expeditions of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but it appears likely that this breed was included among sled teams taken to the Antarctic during the heyday of polar exploration.
The modern Samoyed retains the sociable and easy-going temperament that made it so valued as part of a nomadic family. Behind the “smiling” expression characteristic of the breed is an affectionate nature and a desire

to be friends with everyone. However, the
Samoyed retains the watchdog instincts for which it was bred. Although never aggressive, it will bark at anything that arouses its suspicion. This dog craves company and likes to be kept occupied mentally and physically. Intelligent and spirited, a bored or lonely Samoyed will resort to mischief – whether it is digging holes or finding a way to escape through a fence. The breed responds well to thoughtful handling,
but training requires patience and persistence on the part of its owner.
Daily grooming is essential to keep the Samoyed’s magnificent, stand-out coat in order and maintain its distinctive silvery sheen. Seasonal shedding of the undercoat can be very heavy but, except in very warm conditions, normally occurs only once a year.

HIGH SPEED
On the racetrack, Greyhounds have been recorded as reaching top speeds of around 45 mph
(72 kph). They are one of the fastest living animals.

SIGHT HOUNDS

Canine speed merchants, the sight hounds — or gazehounds as they are sometimes called — are hunting dogs that locate and follow their prey primarily by using their keen eyesight.
Streamlined, lightly framed, but powerful, a sight hound in pursuit of quarry moves fast and turns with great flexibility.
Many dogs in this group were bred to hunt specific prey.

As shown by archaeological evidence,
lean, leggy dogs have been hunting alongside humans for thousands of years, but the early development of modern sight hounds is not entirely clear. It is likely that many crosses involving a diversity of other breeds,
including terriers, went into the creation of classic sight hounds such as the Greyhound and the Whippet.
Most sight hounds are easily recognizable as a type. Selective breeding has developed characteristics designed to promote speed: strong,
supple backs and an athletic build enable the body to stretch out at full gallop; long-striding, elastic limbs,
and powerful hind quarters to provide impulsion. Another characteristic is a long, narrow head that either lacks a pronounced stop or, as in the case of

the Borzoi, has no stop at all. Typically in a sight hound bred to hunt and snap up small prey, the head is carried low when the dog runs at full stretch.
Another common feature of sight hounds is a deep chest accommodating a larger than usual heart and allowing for good lung capacity. Short or fine silky coats tend to be the norm among this group of dogs; only the Afghan
Hound is very long-haired.
Graceful and aristocratic, sight hounds during their history have been the favoured hunting dogs of the wealthy and well born. Greyhounds,
or at least coursing dogs very similar to the modern breed, were kept by the pharaohs of ancient Egypt. Salukis were, and occasionally still are, used by sheikhs for hunting gazelle in the desert. In pre-Soviet
Russia the spectacular
Borzoi was the dog of choice for

HOME LIFE
Many former racing
Greyhounds settle down well as family companions.
Their desire to chase can be channelled into play.

Dogs like these Irish Wolfhounds were used for hunting in Roman times

the nobility and even royalty, specifically bred for running down and killing wolves.
Today, sight hounds are used for racing and coursing and are very often kept as pets. Usually non-aggressive,
although sometimes a little aloof, sight hounds make attractive family dogs but need handling with caution when out of doors and may be best exercised on a lead. Their instinct to chase small animals can be strong enough to override all obedience training. A sight hound chasing after what it perceives to be prey is almost impossible to stop.

The long-nosed Borzoi looks purely decorative, but this dog was once used in Russia for hunting and could bring down a fully grown wolf.

The fastest domesticated animal for its weight, the Whippet is capable of speeds of up to 35mph (56kph). It has impressive powers of acceleration, and can twist and turn at speed with dexterity. This elegant little dog was developed in the north of
England in the late 19th century by crossing the Greyhound (see p.126) with various terriers. Originally bred for hunting hare,
rabbit, and other small game, the Whippet soon became popular as an affordable sporting dog. Whippet racing, held wherever there was enough space for dogs to sprint a couple of hundred metres, became a regular fixture for working men of mill and mining towns. Today, it is still used for racing, as well as lure coursing and agility trials, but is mostly kept as a pet.
Quiet, docile, and affectionate, the Whippet behaves well in the house and is gentle with children. A sensitive breed, it needs tactful

handling and is easily distressed by rough play or harsh commands. With its delicate skin and short, fine hair, the Whippet needs to wear a coat in cold weather. Its own coat is almost odour-free, without a “doggy”
smell even when wet. Puppies with long coats are occasionally born but are not officially recognized.
The Whippet has abundant energy and should be given regular exercise and, in safe areas, plenty of opportunity to run free. It is generally good with other dogs but has a strong hunting instinct and chases cats and small animals if given the chance. A Whippet will tolerate, or at least ignore, a household cat if the two are raised together, but it should not be left unsupervised with other family pets such as rabbits or guinea pigs.
This breed is wary with strangers, so it makes a reasonable watchdog. Towards its owners,
the Whippet shows unswerving loyalty.

This large, frilly-haired, almost feline dog is arguably the most aristocratic of sight hounds. Once known as the Russian Wolfhound, it was bred to hunt wolves for tsars and nobles; often over 100 of these dogs would chase wolves through the snowbound tundra. Outside Russia the Borzoi has been bred for many years for companionship. Today, the dog is happy in a regular home environment but needs plenty of long walks and runs. It also requires a routine of brushing and bathing to keep its long, wavy coat lustrous.

PACK HUNTING
Fox-hunting with pack hounds was once a familiar rural sight.
The modern alternative is drag-hunting – where hounds follow an artificial scent.

SCENT HOUNDS

A keen sense of smell is an essential part of being a dog.
The sharpest noses belong to the scent hounds, which track prey more by following scent than by using their eyes as the sight hounds do (see pp.124–25). These dogs, some of which hunt in packs, have a natural ability to pick up a trail, even if it is days old, and will follow it single-mindedly.

It is not known exactly when certain dogs were first recognized for their exceptional ability to hunt by scent.
The origins of the modern scent hound possibly date back to the mastiff-type dogs of the ancient world, brought into
Europe by traders from the region that is now Syria. By the Middle Ages hunting with packs of scent hounds was a widespread and popular sport, the quarry including fox, hare, deer, and wild boar. Pack-hunting arrived in
North America in the 17th century with English settlers who brought their own foxhounds with them.
Scent hounds come in all sizes, but typically have substantial muzzles packed with odour-detecting sensors,
loose, moist lips that also aid scent detection, and long, pendant ears. Bred for staying power rather than speed,
they are strong-bodied, especially in the forequarters. The breeds of scent

hound known today were selectively developed not only according to the size of prey that they followed but to the countryside that the hunts covered. The English Foxhound, for example, is comparatively fleet and lightly built for leading a mounted hunt over mostly open terrain. Similar in general appearance but much smaller,
the Beagle hunted hare, sometimes in thick undergrowth, with followers on foot. Some short-legged dogs were bred to follow or dig out quarry below ground. The best known of these small scent hounds is the Dachshund, an agile little dog, adept at getting in and out of tight spots. The
Otterhound, which hunted its quarry in rivers and streams, sometimes swimming for much of the time, has a water-repellent coat and more extensive webbing between its toes than most dogs.
Hunting with a pack of hounds is currently banned in England,
Wales, and Scotland, and so the future of some pack hounds, such as the
EVER POPULAR
Long-eared and low-slung, the Basset Hound was once much admired for its hunting ability and is now loved for its appearance alone.

The Otterhound is one of the rarest scent hound breeds

English Foxhound or Harrier is uncertain.
Although usually gregarious and good with other dogs, pack hounds rarely make satisfactory house pets. They need space, are often vocal, and their eagerness to follow any scent trail can make them difficult to train.

As its name suggests, this shaggy-coated hound was once used for hunting otters.
Though its exact origins are uncertain, dogs of a similar type, working in packs, were known in England from about the 18th century, and there are records of otterhunting with pack hounds as far back as the 12th century. When otters became a protected species, and otter-hunting was banned in the UK in 1978, the number of
Otterhounds declined sharply. The breed is now considered rare, with fewer than
60 puppies being registered by the Kennel
Club each year. Small numbers of Otterhounds are found in other countries, including the
USA, Canada, and New Zealand.
The Otterhound is a strong, energetic dog that, given sufficient exercise, readily adapts to life in the home. It is intelligent and good-natured but, as is the case with many former pack hounds, can be difficult to train. Being large and boisterous, the breed is not recommended for small homes

or families with elderly members or young children, as there is a risk of them being knocked over. The
Otterhound is best suited to owners who enjoy outdoor activities and have a large garden or access to open spaces where the dog can run safely. Bred for hunting in water, this hound loves swimming and will splash around happily in streams for hours, if given the opportunity.
The Otterhound’s dense, coarse coat is slightly oily, and therefore water-repellent. Regular grooming is usually enough to keep the long topcoat free from tangles; in wet weather mud tends to collect but can be brushed out easily when dry. The dog’s longer facial hair may need washing occasionally.

A sturdy, compact dog with a merry disposition, the Beagle looks rather like an
English Foxhound (see p.158) in miniature.
The Beagle’s origins are unclear, but it appears to have a long history, possibly being developed from other English scent hounds such as the Harrier (see p.150). In
England, from the 16th century onwards,
packs of small beagle-type hounds were kept to hunt hare and rabbit, but it was not until the 1870s that a standard for the modern
Beagle was recognized. Since then the breed has remained remarkably popular, at first for hunting and now as a companion dog. This versatile hound has also been used by law enforcement agencies to sniff out drugs, explosives, and other illegal items.
The Beagle’s friendly and tolerant nature makes it an excellent pet, provided it has plenty of company and exercise – it does not easily tolerate long periods of solitude,

which may lead to behavioural problems.
A typical scent hound, this dog is highly active and has a strong instinct for following a trail. Left alone in an inadequately fenced garden, or allowed to run off the lead, a
Beagle can disappear swiftly and stay away for hours. The breed has a loud bark and can be noisy, which may irritate neighbours if the barking becomes excessive. Fortunately,
Beagles are relatively easy to train, and do best with an owner who combines fondness with firmness and clear leadership. This breed is good with children old enough to understand how to handle a dog, but cannot be considered safe with small family pets.
In the United States two sizes are recognized, based on the height of the dog at the withers: those under 33cm (13in) and those between 33cm (13in) and 38cm (15in).

A rare breed, the Schillerstovare is much prized for its hunting speed and stamina, especially over snow. This dog’s thick coat insulates it well from its native climate. It tracks alone, rather than in a pack, and emits a deep-throated bay to pinpoint the position of its prey – hare or fox. The breed is named after its breeder, farmer Per Schiller.

The ancestry of the English Foxhound goes back centuries. By the
1800s more than 200 packs of foxhounds were kept in England for hunting foxes over a variety of terrain. An active, bold, and passionate hunter, this hound is highly responsive to training but can also be stubborn and self-willed, especially when on the scent. Historically kennelled in packs rather than kept as house dogs, the English
Foxhound nevertheless makes a good companion, is very friendly towards people, and is excellent with children. Would-be owners should be aware that these hounds can retain their playfulness,
liveliness, and stamina into old age.

It shows an effortless trot and never appears to get tired. Quite similar to the Treeing Walker Coonhound (see p.161), it can adopt both the “cold nose” trail (straddling an old track for hours to locate the animal that left it) or follow a scent fast in pursuit of a fresh, active trail. As a pet, it needs firm handling but in return will be a devoted companion and good guard dog.

THIS FRIENDLY, LIKEABLE FRENCH HOUND MAKES A WELL-BEHAVED HUNTING COMPANION

The sometimes precocious Artois Hound is an excellent hunting companion that needs lots of exercise. It can be distinguished from other French scent hounds by its flat, open, pendant ears. The Artois
Hound has a strong directional sense, a very keen nose, precise pointing, speed on the move, and drive. Its ancestry goes back to the Great Artois Hound (and back to the Saint Hubert),
while some English blood also modified the breed. In the early 1990s this robust and courageous hunter of hare,
deer, and boar was brought back from near extinction,
although it is still rare.

low-slung dog, it is not fast moving but makes up for lack of speed with great determination, tracking quarry for hours once on the scent. This hound is an enthusiastic outdoor companion as well as a fine household pet but,
like many hounds, takes patience to train and socialize.

Tricolour Hound, see p.170). Today,
these strong, well-muscled pack dogs hunt game such as deer and wild boar.

Like several French scent hounds, the name says what it is: a tricoloured dog with cross-Channel connections – the “Great” refers to the game it hunts,
such as red deer, not the dog’s size. Its coat and character come from the tricolored Poitevin (see p.168), and the powerful muscles and stamina from the English Foxhound (see p.158).

This Anglo-French scent hound is one of three colour-based varieties recognized as separate breeds. It originated in the 1800s from a mix of
Bleu de Gascogne and Gasçon Saintongeois hounds crossed with
English Foxhound (see p.158). Most live in kennels in France, and are used to hunt deer in packs.
Very few of these powerful,

FRENCH WHITE AND BLACK HOUND

A SWIFT-FOOTED, STAMINA-PACKED HUNTER THAT GIVES ENDLESS CHASE

There is a growing population of these big, powerful dogs in France, and it is perhaps not surprising given that this handsome breed is highly regarded for hunting roe deer in packs. It is a friendly dog but more likely to form a close relationship with its master in kennels than an owner in a modern house. It may have links with the famous Hound of Saintonge, whose own origins are uncertain but which was bred to hunt wolves. The modern French White and Black Hound is a mix of Bleu de Gascogne and Gasçon Saintongeois hounds.

Despite their small size, Dachshunds need plenty of exercise and mental stimulation to maintain their cheerful and loving temperament.
Strong-willed, they tend to ignore commands when on the scent of prey. Dachshunds will bark protectively at unexpected visitors but are good with older children. There are three coat types: smoothhaired, long-haired, and wire-haired. The long-haired varieties need daily grooming. Two sizes are recognized by the KC,
Black and tan miniature and standard; but three sizes, based on chest coat, coarse to touch circumference, are recognized by the FCI.

This breed, also known as the Swiss Hound, is a keen-nosed tracker that moves easily across Alpine terrain. It is bred to sniff out the track of hare, fox, and roe deer with its long muzzle. There are four distinct varieties – Bernese, Lucerne, Schwyz Laufhunds, and the Bruno Jura (p.138) – each named after a Swiss canton and identified by its coat colours. (A further variety, the Thurgovia, has died out.) The fine sculpted head and well-proportioned body lends the Schweizer Laufhund an air of nobility.

Rottweiler (see p.81), the Greyhound (see p.126), and the Weimaraner
(see p.246). From these, the Dobermann inherited a collection of admirable traits, including guarding and tracking abilities, intelligence,
endurance, speed, and good looks. Widely used for police and security work, this breed is also popular as a town or country house dog.
Dobermanns love being part of family life – the more active the better.

(formerly Rhodesia), the breed may have descended from dogs brought to southern Africa by European settlers. Because the Rhodesian Ridgeback was once used in packs to hunt lions, it is sometimes known as the
African Lion Hound. Despite the breed’s fierce image, it is kindnatured and affectionate, and is a good family companion for experienced owners. This dog needs to be kept occupied, as it may develop behavioural problems if bored or under-exercised.

DIGGING INSTINCT
Intent on his task, this Airedale
Terrier is doing what comes naturally – excavating a hole.
Most terriers are inveterate diggers and tunnellers.

Tough, fearless, self-confident, energetic — a terrier can claim all of these descriptions, and more. The terrier group takes its name from the Latin word terra (earth), referring to the original use of various types of small dog as hunters of underground-dwelling vermin, such as rats. However, some modern terriers are large dogs, bred for different purposes.

Many breeds of terrier originated in the UK, where they were traditionally regarded as hunting dogs for the working man. Some are named after the regions they first came from:
Norwich Terrier, Yorkshire Terrier, and
Lakeland Terrier. Others are known by the types of animal they used to hunt:
for example, Fox Terrier and Rat Terrier.
Terriers are by nature quick to react and show great persistence when on the track of quarry. They possess independent, some would say wilful,
characters and are ready to stand their ground against larger dogs. The dogs developed for hunting below ground,
including the much-loved Jack Russell and Cairn Terriers, are small, sturdy, and short-legged. Terriers with longer legs, such as the Irish Terrier and the beautiful Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier,
were once used for hunting above

ground and also as guard dogs for protecting flocks. The largest terriers of all include the Airedale Terrier, originally bred for hunting otter, and the impressively built Russian Black Terrier,
which was specifically developed for military use and guard duties.
In the 19th century, a different type of terrier became popular. Crosses between terriers and bulldogs produced such dogs as the Bull Terrier,
the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, and the
American Pit Bull Terrier, breeds intended for the vicious and now illegal sports of pit-fighting and bull-baiting. With their broad heads and powerful jaws,
these dogs suggest a close affinity with mastiffs and are, in fact, likely to be related to that group.
Most types of terrier are today kept as pets. Intelligent and usually friendly and affectionate, they make excellent companions and watchdogs.
Because of their inherent traits,
terriers need to be trained and socialized early to prevent problems
LIVELY COMPANION
The sparky Jack Russell is among the best known of various small working terrier breeds now enjoying popularity as pets.

Once a fighting dog, the Bull
Terrier is now a family favourite

with other dogs and pets. Hunting-type terriers also love to dig and can wreak havoc in a garden if unsupervised.
The modern breeds of those dogs historically used for fighting are now largely free from aggression and, when properly trained by an experienced owner, are usually trustworthy with families.
MIXED HISTORY
Terriers have highly variable origins.

A 20th-century breed developed for burrowing work, this dog is also known as the Czech or Bohemian Terrier. It is still used as a working dog, and its natural wariness of strangers makes it a useful watchdog. For a terrier, this dog has a relatively relaxed,
playful character and it is sometimes simply kept as a companion.
However, the breed retains some terrier stubbornness and an inclination to snap, so needs consistent training from an early age. The typical clip of the coat is short on the body, leaving long curtains of hair on the face, legs, and belly.

This small terrier was bred from various rat-catching dogs, and is an energetic hunter. Because ratters work in packs, this breed is more sociable with other dogs than most terriers, but cannot be trusted with other pets. It makes a good guard dog or companion for families with older children.

Oblivious to its tiny toy stature, the
Yorkshire Terrier has the bravery, energy,
and confidence that might be expected of a dog several times its size. An intelligent dog, it responds well to obedience training.
However, it is inclined to take advantage of owners who let it get away with behaviour that would be unacceptable in a larger dog and can become yappy, snappy, and demanding. With proper handling, this terrier displays its natural character:
sweet, affectionate, loyal, and spirited.
The Yorkshire Terrier was developed to catch the rats and mice that infested the woollen mills and mine shafts in the north of England. It was gradually miniaturized through breeding from the smallest individuals, and over time became a fashion accessory that was carried around by its lady owner. However, such pampering is at odds with the Yorkshire Terrier’s dynamic nature and it is much happier when allowed to walk for at least half an hour each day. The long,

glossy show coat is wrapped around folded papers and secured with elastic bands to protect it outside the show ring. It is very time-consuming to maintain but the dogs generally love the extra attention.

CLIPPED COAT
Owners who do not intend to show their dogs usually clip the coat short every few months.

Despite its small size, the Biewer Terrier enjoys long walks and is a loyal and entertaining companion. It is a colour variant of the Yorkshire Terrier that first appeared in Germany in 1984
when a blue, white, and gold puppy appeared in a litter produced from a cross between two normally coloured
Yorkshire Terriers. Imported to the US in 2003, the dog’s popularity increased, and it has become popular in other countries too.

Largely the result of cross-breeding between the
Bulldog (see p.94) and terriers of various types, the Bull

Justly known as the “King of Terriers”, the Airedale
Terrier is big, square, and strong. Originating in the valley of the Aire River in Yorkshire, this breed was first developed in the mid-19th century by local hunters who wanted a robust terrier for catching vermin and larger game such as otters. The breed’s subsequent uses have included guarding and military work,
but it is also a popular companion. Friendly,
intelligent, and full of character, this dog, like many terriers, loves the thrill of the chase and can get up to mischief when bored.

First developed in the 1940s, this massively built and hardy terrier was the special creation of the Soviet Army in the former
USSR. The breeders’ aim was to produce a large dog suitable for military work and able to withstand the severe cold of Russian winters. Among many breeds used in its development were the
Giant Schnauzer (see p.41), the Rottweiler (see p.81), and the Airedale Terrier (see p.199).
Still relatively uncommon, the Russian Black
Terrier is becoming more widely recognized outside its native land. Formidable in size and appearance, the breed is not naturally aggressive and with responsible handling is a friendly and well-adjusted house dog.

An energetic and sometimes vocal companion, the Fox Terrier from England was originally kept to kill vermin, hunt rabbit,
and tackle foxes that had been run to ground.
Its bold and fearless nature and love of digging make early socialization and training essential to prevent snappiness and curb any tendency to dig. If this is done, the Fox Terrier makes a wonderful family pet that loves to play and readily reciprocates any affection it receives.
The Wire Fox Terrier’s coat needs regular grooming and “plucking” to remove any shed hair, and more extensive stripping three or four times a year. The coat should never be clipped because this does not remove shed hair and may cause irritation, and also leads to deterioration in coat texture and colour. The Fox Terrier is ancestral to several other dog breeds, including the Parson
Russell Terrier (see p.195), the Jack Russell

Terrier (see p.196), the Toy Fox Terrier (see p.208), the Brazilian Terrier (see p.209), and the Rat Terrier (see p.211).

Terrier makes an excellent family pet.

Queen Victoria’s reign, when toy dogs became fashionable. Before that it was a rat-catcher.
Like other terriers, this breed veers from cuddly family pet to voracious rodent-hunter. It bonds with its owner and makes a good watchdog. Because it is small, the English Toy

The result is a kindly, attractive, low-maintenance, eager-to-please dog, which makes a good watchdog and, like other terriers, is a keen ratter. While wary of strangers, it is gentle and playful with familiar people and dogs. There are two coat types: rough-haired and smooth-haired.

Originally bred for pit-fighting in the 19th century, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier was developed from crosses between bulldogs and terriers. The modern “Staffie”,
as it is often affectionately known, has moved on from its historical background to become a people-loving pet, enormously popular in both town and country. This dog is robust, boisterous, and possesses legendary courage. A Staffordshire Bull
Terrier is unlikely to back down if challenged by an unfamiliar dog. Firm handling and early obedience training are essential.

SKYE TERRIER

FULL OF CHARACTER, THIS DOG OFTEN BECOMES DEVOTED TO ONE PERSON

A very old breed from the Western Isles of Scotland,
the Skye Terrier was originally used for fox- and badger-hunting. With a long, low-slung body, the Skye
Terrier could easily slip into the narrow underground passages used by its quarry. This elegant little dog is active and good-spirited, and makes an excellent pet, becoming devoted to family and home. The long coat that is characteristic of the breed can take several years to grow to its full adult length. To prevent the hair from matting, a Skye Terrier needs a weekly grooming session.

SOFT MOUTH
Gundogs used for retrieving,
like this dual-purpose English
Springer Spaniel, are trained to carry game without crushing it.

Before the advent of firearms, hunters used dogs to help them locate and chase game. With the introduction of guns,
a different type of dog was required. Gundogs were developed to carry out specific tasks and to work more closely with the hunters. The breeds fall into several categories based on the type of work they were bred to perform.

The dogs in the gundog group, which hunt by scent, are classified broadly in three main divisions: the pointers and setters, which locate prey; the spaniels,
which flush game out of cover; and the retrievers, which collect fallen prey and bring it back to the hunter. Breeds that combine these functions are known as HPR (hunt/point/retrieve) dogs and include the Weimaraner, German Pointer,
and the Hungarian Vizsla.
Pointers have been used as hunting dogs since the 17th century. They have the extraordinary ability to indicate the location of prey by “pointing” –
freezing into position with nose, body,
and tail aligned. A pointer remains motionless until the hunter either flushes out the game or instructs the dog to do so. The English Pointer,
which features in many old sporting portraits alongside hunting squires and their “bags” of game birds, is a classic example of the type.

Setters also direct attention to game by freezing. Typically used to hunt quail, pheasant, and grouse, these dogs crouch, or “set”, when they pick up a scent. Originally, setters were trained to work with hunters who caught game with nets while their dogs prevented the prey from making an escape on the ground.
Spaniels drive out, or flush, game birds, forcing them to take wing into the line of the guns. They watch where a bird falls and are usually sent to retrieve it. This division includes small, silky-coated, long-eared dogs,
such as the Springer Spaniel and
Cocker Spaniel, used for finding game on land, and less familiar breeds, such as the Barbet and the Wetterhoun, which specialize in flushing waterbirds.
The retrievers were bred specifically for retrieving waterfowl. In common with

Retriever is a popular bird dog that, because of its gentle, calm, and lovable temperament,

some breeds of the spaniel division,

This classic gundog is so called because it was originally used to “spring” game –
startle birds into the air. Spaniels used as gundogs were once classified according to their size: the larger dogs (called Springers,
see pp.226–28) were used for flushing game,
and the smaller ones (called Cockers, see pp.222–23) for flushing woodcock. Until the beginning of the 20th century the English
Springer Spaniel was not recognized as an official breed, although it had developed into a distinct type known as the Norfolk Spaniel.
The English Springer Spaniel will work with hunters in the field all day, undeterred by rough terrain or adverse weather conditions, even jumping into freezing water when necessary. This breed is a popular choice with game shooters but its friendly,
biddable disposition makes it an excellent family dog too. It likes company, including children, other dogs, and the household cat.
If left alone for too long, it may resort to

excessive barking. A non-working dog needs long, energetic daily walks and will enjoy having a stream to splash in,
mud to roll in, or toys thrown for it to retrieve. This breed is bright and willing to learn, and will respond to calm authority. It is highly sensitive, so giving harsh or loud commands is likely to be counterproductive.
The English Springer Spaniel’s love of the outdoors means that it needs weekly grooming to prevent its thick coat from becoming matted and dirty,
and regular trimming, especially of the long feathering on the ears and legs.
There are two types of English Springer
Spaniel: working and show. Dogs bred specifically to work in the field tend to have their tails docked and be slightly smaller and of lighter build than dogs produced for showing. Both types make equally good companion dogs.

This French pointer and retriever is a specialist at hunting in water and swampland. The breed is thought to have been developed in the 19th century,
and may include the Irish Water Spaniel (see p.228) in its ancestry. The Pont-Audemer
Spaniel has never been well known, even in France, and by the 20th century was nearly extinct. It survived in small numbers and

One German name for the breed, Heidewachtel or “heath quail dog”,
describes this dog’s first purpose of flushing game birds. Although it is a cheerful and affectionate companion, hunters quickly snap up almost all of the small numbers that are bred each year. Despite its name, this breed is not directly related to the Large

Origin The Netherlands

This breed goes by several other names, including Dutch Decoy Spaniel, which describes its original and unusual role. Romping and waving its flag-like tail, never barking, it was used for centuries to lure and drive curious waterfowl into tunnel traps or “kooien” for hunters to catch alive – a task it still performs today for researchers wanting to tag and release birds. It is a rare breed, but its working history makes it a playful, good-natured dog that is dedicated to its owners, although can be aloof with strangers.

In its native land the French Spaniel is claimed to be the original of all hunting spaniels. It is still used for hunting at home and abroad, but because it is level-headed and not inclined to bark, it also makes a good city dog, as long as it is given enough exercise and affection.

Origin Ireland

The red dog, or Modder Rhu, of Ireland started out as a hunting dog and is still an effective worker, but today is more commonly kept as a striking and spirited companion. Slow to mature, it needs firm training from an early age. The breed’s devil-may-care attitude and tendency to get into scrapes when young can try an owner’s patience, but its sociable nature and zest for life make it worth the extra effort. It does not simply tolerate other dogs and children,
but actively seeks them out to play with.

A superlative hunting dog, which tracks, points, and retrieves over any terrain from heathland to marshland, the German Pointer or Deutsch
Kurzhaar is a loyal, obedient breed. In its homeland it has always been kept for the home as well as the hunt, and the breed is generally level-headed and reliable. This is an energetic dog, and individuals can become hyperactive and destructive if they are not given enough exercise. There are three coat types: wire-haired,
long-haired, and short-haired. By far the best known is the
German Short-haired Pointer, called GSP by hunters in the UK.

Created as an all-purpose hunting, pointing, and retrieving gundog, this 19th-century breed, nicknamed the “Grey Ghost”,
is a careful, almost stealthy dog in the field. While the
Weimaraner may be reserved with strangers, it is a bouncy family companion and can be too boisterous for small children. Elegant lines, striking colour, and grace in movement have contributed to this breed’s popularity both as a pet and working dog, but it can stay active for hours, and needs an owner with similar stamina.

One of the most familiar dogs, the Labrador
Retriever has been topping “popular dog”
lists for at least two decades. The dogs from which the present-day Labrador Retriever descended were not from Labrador, as is commonly supposed, but from Newfoundland.
Here, from the 18th century onwards, black dogs with waterproof coats were bred by local fishermen and used to help tow in catches and retrieve escaping fish. Dogs of this early type no longer exist, but a few were brought to England in the 19th century and these led to the development of the modern Labrador Retriever. By the early 20th century the breed was officially recognized and continued to be much admired by field sportsmen for its excellent retrieving skills.
Today, the Labrador Retriever is still widely used as a gundog and has proved efficient at other types of work, such as tracking

for police forces. In particular, its steady character makes it a superb guide dog for the blind. However, it is as a family dog that this breed has gained great popularity. The
Labrador Retriever is loving and lovable,
easy to train, anxious to please, and reliable with children and household pets – but it has too amiable a character to make a good guard dog.
This breed has energy to burn and needs to be kept mentally as well as physically active. Long daily walks are essential,
preferably with the chance to have a swim along the way. If this dog sees water, it will plunge straight in. Under-exercised and left to its own devices, a Labrador Retriever may be given to excessive barking or become destructive. It tends to gain weight quickly,
and lack of exercise combined with its insatiable appetite can lead to weight problems.

COMPANION DOGS

Almost any dog can provide companionship. Many dogs once used for outside duties, such as herding, have moved indoors with the family. Usually, these breeds have been developed for specific tasks and so are traditionally grouped according to their primary function. With a few exceptions,
the companion dogs included here are bred solely as pets.

Most companion dogs are small breeds,
created primarily to sit on laps, look decorative, and entertain their owners without taking up much room. Some of them are toy versions of larger working breeds. The Standard Poodle, for example, once used for herding or for retrieving waterfowl, was bred down in size to a toy dog that could no longer perform any practical function.
Other, larger, dogs sometimes grouped with companion breeds include the
Dalmatian, whose career included a short-lived spell as a carriage escort,
as much for prestige as guard duty.
Now that this job no longer exists,
Dalmatians are rarely used for any working purpose.
Companion dogs have a long history.
A number of them originated thousands of years ago in China, where small dogs were kept in the imperial courts as ornaments and a source of comfort.
Until the late 19th century, companion

dogs everywhere were almost exclusively the pampered pets of the wealthy. As such, they often featured in portraits, depicted sitting prettily in the drawing room or with children as a nursery plaything. Some, such as the
King Charles Spaniel, owe their enduring popularity to the former patronage of royalty.
Appearance has always mattered in the breeding of companion dogs. Over the centuries, selective breeding has produced characteristics, some bizarre, that serve no useful function but are designed to appeal – for example, the human-like flat faces and large,
round eyes of the
Pekingese and
LIVELY COMPANION
Although Dalmatians have great energy and stamina, they are nearly always kept as pets rather than for practical uses.
SMALLEST DOG
Few companion breeds come smaller than the diminutive and delightful Russian Toy.

The Pug’s flat face and round eyes are designed to appeal

the Pug. Some have extravagantly long coats, curly tails, or — in the case of the
Chinese Crested Dog — no hair at all apart from a few strategically placed tufts on the head or legs.
In modern times, companion dogs are no longer a symbol of class. They find a place with owners of all ages and circumstances, in small apartments as well as large country homes. Although still chosen for their looks, these dogs are also sought after as friends that give and demand affection and adapt happily to family activities.

Hairlessness is a feature of several dog breeds around the world. It is the result of a genetic mutation that was initially considered a curiosity but then became desirable as the breed did not harbour fleas, shed hair, or have body odour. Although the Chinese
Crested requires little grooming, its bare skin is sensitive: in winter it needs a coat to keep it warm, and in summer requires protection from the intense heat of the sun, which can burn and dry out its skin. This delicate skin,
combined with the fact that the Chinese
Crested needs little exercise and activity,
makes it unsuitable for families that spend a lot of time outdoors. However,
it is an ideal companion dog for older people due to its happy and friendly nature and playful personality.
Some Chinese Crested dogs are more lightly built than others. These fine-boned individuals are referred

to as the deer type, while Chinese
Crested dogs that have a heavier build are known as the cobby type.

POWDERPUFF VARIETY
Unlike the hairless variety, the Powderpuff
Chinese Crested has a long, soft coat, which needs regular grooming to prevent matting.

Origin Unknown

Particularly popular in Britain during the early 19th century,
the Dalmatian was known as the “carriage dog”, because it was trained to run under or beside horse-drawn carriages and fire engines, often travelling very long distances. The only spotted dog breed, the Dalmatian is intelligent, friendly,
and outgoing, and makes an excellent companion. However,
it does have a lot of energy and can be stubborn and aggressive with other dogs, so an owner needs to dedicate time to training. The puppies are born pure white, making it difficult to predict whether the spots will be black or liver once mature; this dog’s white coat sheds a great deal.

An old breed and unknown outside Thailand until the mid-1970s, the Thai
Ridgeback has since gained recognition in other countries. It was used for hunting,
to follow carts, and as a guard dog. Its earlier geographic isolation has resulted in most of its original natural instincts and drives remaining, as there were few chances for it to breed with other dogs. Today, it is primarily kept as a companion dog, and is naturally protective of its home and family. It can make a loyal, loving pet, but is often suspicious of

This attractive dog is a cross between a Standard Poodle and a Golden Retriever. The characteristics of the poodle parent are clearly visible.

Dogs of mixed breeding vary from the so-called designer dogs,
with purebred parents of two different recognized breeds, to the bit-of-everything type, the result of accidental, random crosses (see p.290). Some designer hybrids are now extremely fashionable. They are mostly given whimsical combination names, such as Cockapoo (a Cocker Spaniel–Poodle cross).

One of the reasons for creating modern designer dogs was to mix the desired characteristics from one breed with the non-shedding, hypoallergenic coat of another. A cross of this type currently enjoying great popularity is the Labradoodle, a mixture of
Labrador Retriever and Poodle.
However, even when the parents are readily recognized breeds such as these, it may be impossible to predict which side of the family the puppies will favour. Labradoodles, for example,
show little consistency from litter to litter, some puppies inheriting the curly poodle coat while others are more obviously influenced by the Labrador parent. Such lack of standardization is common in designer crosses, although occasionally it has proved possible to produce a standard and breed dogs to type. An example of this is the
Lucas Terrier, the result of crossing

the Sealyham Terrier and the Norfolk
Terrier. Currently, it is rare for such crosses to achieve breed recognition.
Deliberate mixing of two specific breeds to produce particular characteristics has proliferated since the end of the 20th century, but is by no means a modern trend. One of the best-known crossbreeds, the Lurcher,
has been around for several hundred years. This dog combines the qualities of speedy sight hounds, such as the
Greyhound and Whippet, with desirable traits found in other breeds, such as the collie’s enthusiasm for work and the tenacity of the terrier.
Prospective owners of a designer dog should take into account the personalities and temperaments of both breeds involved in the mix. These may be very different and either one might predominate. It is also important to consider both parent dogs’ requirements for general care and exercise.
All crossbred dogs are commonly believed to be more intelligent than pedigree dogs,

HEALTHY DOG
Random-bred dogs, like this terrier cross, are usually robust and are largely free from inherited disorders.

but there is no sound evidence for this.
Random breeds are often said to be healthier than purebreds, and it is true that they are at much lower risk of the inherited diseases prevalent in some breeds.

The original Labrador-Poodle cross was intended as an assistance dog for allergy sufferers, but the Labradoodle has rapidly gained popularity as a family pet. In Australia, it is on its way to being a breed with a written standard. Elsewhere, this remains a crossbreed, with no official status but in huge demand. The dog’s personality attracts owners as much as its appearance. It is consistently level-headed and biddable without becoming serious or reserved.

One of the newest “designer dogs”, this mixture of the Golden Retriever (see p.258) and the Poodle (see p.271) was first bred in the USA in the 1990s. Since then the Goldendoodle’s growing popularity has encouraged breeders elsewhere to continue its development. Most of these dogs are first-generation crosses and vary considerably in appearance – some have curly coats,
while others are wavy or straight. The crossbreed’s size depends on whether the Poodle parent is a medium,
miniature, or toy variety. Although lively and energetic, Goldendoodles have gentle temperaments and are usually easy to train.
They get on well with children and other pets.

GUIDE TO BREEDS

RANDOM-BRED DOGS

THESE DOGS MAY LACK A PEDIGREE BUT THEY CAN PROVIDE LOVE, COMPANIONSHIP, AND FUN

Dogs with random breeding are usually of unknown ancestry, with the parents themselves likely to be the result of accidental mixings that may go back several generations. Choosing a random-bred puppy is a bit of a lottery for prospective owners as it is difficult to predict what the dog will look like at maturity. Many of the dogs available for adoption in rescue centres are random crossbreds;
in the majority of cases they make excellent pets.
SOFT AND SILKY
Many random-bred dogs resemble sheepdogs with soft coats and feathering on the chest, legs, and tail.
This dog has sheepdog markings too.

LONG AND SHAGGY
Puppies with soft, fluffy coats often grow up to have long,
coarse coats, like this dog’s, that require regular grooming to prevent matting.

Long hairs cover feet

LARGE DOG
Random-bred dogs can grow to any size or shape. This large dog may be the same size as one or other of its parents or somewhere in between the two.

SHORT AND

The short coat and drop ears of this dog suggest a hound-like ancestor, but its merle colouring is less easy to explain.

MEDIUM-SIZED DOG

Well-feathered tail

SMALL DOG
This small dog has some distinctly terrier-like features, including semi-erect ears and a broad head.

UNIQUE APPEARANCE
Unlike pedigree dogs, no two random-bred dogs are alike.
This dog may resemble a terrier superficially but its offspring may look very different.

CARE AND

CARE AND TRAINING

PREPARING FOR ARRIVAL
Forward thinking and early preparation will help to make your puppy’s introduction to his new home as stress free as possible. Before the newest member of the family arrives, check that the home environment,
both indoors and outdoors, is safe for a young, inquisitive dog. Ensure too that you have all the basic equipment needed for his daily care and development, including his collar, bed, and toys.

Puppy-proofing your home
Start your safety checks by walking around your home and garden and trying to see everything as your puppy would see it. What looks like a tempting object to chew? Is that table in a prime position to be knocked over? Is there a small gap in the fence that he could squeeze through if he tried?
Take preventive action now to avoid trouble later.

Safety indoors
Making your home safe for a dog is similar to making it safe for children. Dogs investigate a new object by chewing it, so place anything potentially hazardous well out of a puppy’s reach. Toxic household chemicals are an obvious danger but your puppy could be poisoned by many other things, such as certain pot plants and some human foods, including chocolate.
Remind children not to leave small toys lying around for your puppy to pick up and choke on. Watch out for electrical wires,
remote controls, and anything else near the floor and small enough for a puppy to gnaw. Objects that you may think are

A puppy is life-changing

out of reach may be accidents waiting to happen; a washing basket is easy to knock over and its contents can create hours of fun for a destructive puppy. Consider keeping some doors closed or using a stair gate to limit the areas that your dog can access. Excitable dogs can suffer back and leg injuries from slips and falls on smooth or polished floors. Put down non-slip mats; if they are machine-washable, it will be easy to deal with dirt and stains.

Safety outdoors
Look for gaps in fences and underneath gates, even if you plan to supervise your dog outside. Puppies can disappear through the smallest holes and thickest hedges if they think there is something interesting on the other side. Keep garden chemicals out of the way. Slug pellets and other pesticides can look like tasty treats, but may be harmful if eaten. Do not let your puppy chew garden plants – many are poisonous.
Avoid leaning tools or wheelbarrows against fences where a boisterous puppy could knock them over and cause injury.

HAZARDS FOR YOUR DOG TO AVOID

TOP TIPS
■ Book a vet’s appointment to complete your puppy’s vaccinations soon after you bring him home.
■ Microchipping your dog improves the likelihood of finding him if he gets lost, and is compulsory in some countries.
■ Pet insurance can provide peace of mind in an emergency.

■ Ask your breeder for a towel or blanket that smells familiar to your puppy. It will help to reassure him for the first few nights.

P R E PA R I N G FO R A R R I VA L

Collars and leads

Harnesses and halters

To begin with, you will need to buy a small, light puppy collar and replace it as your dog grows. The style of collar depends on what your dog finds most comfortable. For example,
long-haired breeds will find a smooth, rolled leather collar more comfortable because it does not pull on their coat as much as a nylon collar. Greyhound-type breeds are happier with a wide, flat collar that is less likely to damage their sensitive necks. Whatever type of dog you have, make sure that the width of his collar exceeds the width of one of his neck vertebrae. When choosing a lead, simply handle a few to see which one feels most comfortable for you.

A typical harness fits around the body with the lead attaching on the dog’s back. This can be beneficial for some dogs, as it removes tension from around the neck, but harnesses can be fiddly to take on and off, especially with an exuberant or over-excited dog. The harness straps should be well fitted at all points, leaving enough room for you to slip two fingers easily between the harness and the dog’s body. Contrary to popular belief, harnesses do not stop a dog from pulling on the lead; only training can do that.
If you have a dog that is a determined puller, you may find a halter with a fixed noseband helps to restrain him.

THE RIGHT COLLAR
Choose a collar for comfort,
not fashionable appearance.
Avoid collars that tighten when the dog pulls, such as check chains or half-check collars.

FITTING A COLLAR
A collar should fit securely around a dog’s neck without being too tight. As a guide,
you should be able to fit two fingers between the collar and the dog’s neck. Check the fit regularly as your puppy grows and alter it as necessary.
Replace the collar as soon as your puppy grows out of it.

HARNESSES AND HALTERS
Instead of a collar, you may prefer to use a harness or halter. These must fit correctly and be introduced to a dog carefully. Some short legged dogs cannot wear harnesses and short muzzled dogs cannot wear halters.

CARE AND TRAINING

Types of bed
Dog beds vary widely in price, and until your puppy is settled and fully house-trained it is not worth investing in anything expensive. A new dog may chew or soil his bed, so look for a cheap and washable option.
There are two main types of bed: hard and soft. Hard beds, made from moulded plastic, are easy to keep clean.
They are also relatively difficult for a young puppy to chew,
although a dog who has his adult teeth may inflict some damage. You can use disposable items such as old towels to make a plastic bed comfortable for your dog, safe in the knowledge that you can wash or discard bedding that gets chewed or soiled. These beds are also a good choice for an older dog who suffers from incontinence. Soft, foam-filled beds are more comfortable to sleep on, especially for an older dog who is beginning to experience stiffness in his joints. Although the cover may be washable, these beds are not suitable for young puppies because they like nothing better than pulling the bed’s foam filling out, leaving you with the expense of a replacement bed.

STAIR GATE
Use a stair gate to keep your young dog safe in one room without making him feel trapped.

Cages and playpens
Until your new puppy is house-trained, use a cage or a playpen as his personal space. Never confine your dog as a punishment. A cage or playpen should be a place that your dog enjoys — you may even feed him there. A
playpen also gives you peace of mind, safely containing your puppy away from trouble while you are in another room. If you introduce your puppy to a cage when he is young and only shut the door for short periods, he will be happy to use it should it be necessary if he is ill or when you are going on a long journey. However, do not restrict your dog to a cage for long periods as this can increase the risk of behavioural problems.
Keep the gate open unless you leave the room

DOG BEDS
Plastic beds are hygienic and hard-wearing. Pad them with soft bedding to make your dog comfortable.
Foam-filled beds and beanbags are cosy and attractive but are not suitable for young puppies until they are house-trained and have stopped chewing. Soft beds usually have washable covers that can be removed.

Playpen
USING A CAGE
A cage or playpen allows you to leave your puppy unsupervised when you are busy. He will probably sleep some of the time, but give him plenty of toys to keep him amused. Do not leave him confined alone for long periods at a time.

P R E PA R I N G FO R A R R I VA L

TOYS FOR
YOUNG PUPPIES
Soft toys are best for young puppies who have not yet grown a set of adult teeth. A puppy is likely to go through several toys,
so don’t buy expensive ones.

Soft toys

Rope tugger

Chewable rubber toys

Puppy with chewable rubber ring

Rubber and rope bone

TOYS FOR OLDER PUPPIES
As puppies get older, they will chew vigorously and need more durable toys. Thick rope tuggers, or toys with a combination of rope and chewable rubber,
are a good choice and last a long time.

Buying toys
Toys provide a dog with mental stimulation and something permissible to chew on. Used for games or during training sessions, they are great for encouraging a dog to interact with his owner. When buying toys, choose only those that are specially designed for dogs. Children’s toys are a dangerous substitute as they may have small pieces that a dog can chew off and swallow. Never leave your dog alone with his toys for long periods; even playthings that are meant to be chewed, such as rawhide bones, can be a choking hazard.
Soft toys are best for young puppies while they still have their baby teeth. As puppies get older and begin teething,
they are more likely to chew and at this stage stronger toys such as rope tuggers are the best choice. Once your dog is an adult, choose toys with a variety of textures and shapes.
Toys that can be thrown or tugged are good as long as you are able to play with your dog, otherwise choose a toy that he can chew on. Some chewable toys have tasty flavours and there are also food-dispensing toys that release treats when played with. These can keep a dog entertained for a long

TOYS FOR ADULT DOGS
Adult dogs also love toys and appreciate those with a variety of textures and materials. Harder toys are best, as they will withstand chewing by a mature dog’s full set of teeth.

time, and are useful if you are too busy to play. Dogs that are dedicated chewers can often be kept out of mischief with rubber toys, which are very durable, or the ranges of rubber toys that are designed to be stuffed with food. Most dogs have favourite toys, and you will soon get to know which ones your dog likes best.
TOP TIPS
■ Playing with a tug toy is a great way to train a puppy not to mouth at your hand. Offer to play with him but end the game as soon as his teeth meet your hand.
■ Use food-dispensing toys to keep your dog entertained if you have to leave him alone for short periods.
■ Keep a favourite toy hidden out of your dog’s reach and use it only as a prized reward during training sessions.

CARE AND TRAINING

FOOD AND FEEDING
A puppy’s dietary needs change as he matures

Keeping a dog healthy is largely a question of feeding him the right food in the right quantities. There are several options:
complete, pre-prepared dried or wet foods; raw, uncooked foods; or a diet created from combination of these. Whatever you decide on, aim for a good nutritional balance and tailor the quantities to suit the size and age of your dog.

A balanced diet
Ready-prepared dog food is the choice of many owners as it is both quick and convenient. Reading the labels on processed foods will tell you what type of dog they are suitable for.
Make sure you use a type that is appropriate for your dog’s age. Some foods are available in puppy, junior, adult, and senior varieties, and buying the right formula is important.
When in doubt about what quantities to feed, ask your vet for advice. If you decide to feed your dog a mixture of wet and dried food, be careful to halve the quantity of each so you are not over-feeding him.
A balanced diet consists of the right quantities of nutrients:
proteins, carbohydrates, fat, vitamins, and minerals. Using processed foods ensures that you get the balance right; if you feed your dog fresh food, his diet needs a little more thought. A dog’s nutritional requirements change as he ages. Puppies need high levels of protein and calcium to aid growth and development. Geriatric dogs, on the other hand,
require particularly high-quality protein as well as increased levels of certain vitamins as their kidney function slows down.
Reduced kidney function can lead to dehydration, due to too much water being excreted, so you may decide to feed an older dog a wet diet rather than dried food, to increase his water intake. The sort of food your dog eats will also

such as meat and vegetables, takes a little longer to prepare.

■ Opened packets or tins of wet food will need to be sealed and refrigerated between uses. Dried dog food should also be kept in a sealed container, to keep it fresh and free from contamination.
■ Puppies need three or four small meals a day, but by the time they are mature will only require feeding morning and evening. Feeding your dog smaller meals twice a day as opposed to one big meal is preferable, as it puts less strain on their digestive systems.
■ Introduce new foods gradually over several days to avoid stomach upsets.

Treats and chews
If you use a lot of edible treats to reward your dog during training, you may risk over-feeding him. Consider the treats part of your dog’s overall diet and slightly reduce the amount of food you give him at mealtimes. Alternatively, you can take part of your dog’s main rations to give as treats throughout the day, especially if you use dried food.
Either buy ready-made dog treats from a pet shop or make your own at home by chopping up foods such as cheese, chicken or sausage. Dogs are particularly fond of treats that have a strong smell and taste.
Chews are a great way to keep your dog occupied for a while and provide something to take a puppy’s mind off chewing your household possessions. They are also very effective at keeping a dog’s teeth clean. Be careful what type of chew you give your dog. Canine teeth are extremely strong and can tear apart chews with ease; swallowing the loose parts can lead to choking or a blockage. Never leave a puppy or young dog alone while he has a chew.

TREAT VARIETIES
Using a variety of treats keeps your dog motivated during training and allows you to create a hierarchy of rewards. Knowing which treats appeal most to your dog will make training easier and more enjoyable.

CARE AND TRAINING

FIRST DAYS
Your puppy’s first days in his new home are important to the rest of his development. Start as you intend to go on and set the rules right from the beginning. Do not be tempted to be lenient while your dog settles in. He will feel at home much more quickly and easily if you set clear boundaries. The sooner you establish a routine the sooner you will succeed in training your dog.

Choosing a name
Family discussions about choosing a name that suits your new puppy are likely to be long and difficult. The name should be something that you feel comfortable calling out in public. It must also be clearly distinguishable from any commands you are likely to want to teach your dog. For example, a dog called “Kit” will find learning the command

to “sit” very difficult. Overly long names make training problematic, so pick something with just one or two syllables. Remember that dogs do not understand language,
only sounds. Giving your dog a long name that you shorten in some situations will only confuse him. Also to keep it simple for your dog, make sure that all members of your family use the same name to address him.

TRAINING | TEACHING YOUR DOG HIS NAME

When your puppy is nearby, crouch down and clearly call his name in a cheery,
enthusiastic voice. Use your hands to guide his attention towards you.

As your puppy approaches,
praise him in an excited tone of voice.
Stroke and fuss him when he reaches you.

It’s never too early for a puppy to learn

Make sure you show your puppy how pleased you are to see him by giving him lots of warm attention.
Never use your puppy’s name to scold him.

TRIP OUTSIDE
Your puppy must learn that outside is the place to go to the toilet.
Take your puppy into the garden first thing in the morning and last thing at night as well as whenever he wakes from a nap. Also, go outside with him after each feed or after playing with him.

puppy appears to be clean. It may be simply that you have become better at predicting your puppy’s toilet habits and not that he has learned to control himself indoors.

What to do at night
Inevitably, your new puppy will cry or whine at night-time.
This is a natural response to being separated from his mother and litter mates and is unlikely to last for more than a few nights. Ignore him, unless he is being very noisy, in which case he may need to go to the toilet. If you can take him outside to relieve himself in the middle of the night,
he will learn to be clean indoors much more quickly. Tiring your puppy out during the day is the best way of getting a peaceful night. Spending time playing with him and feeding him a warm evening meal will make him feel sleepy. Always give your puppy the opportunity to go to the toilet just before you settle him down in his bed.

House-training
Some dogs learn to be clean indoors sooner than others, but with all of them the most important factor in house-training is vigilance. Supervision is the key to success in the first few weeks. Your puppy may need to relieve himself at any time,
so learn to spot the signs, such as sniffing the ground and circling. You can also try to predict the times when he is most likely to need the toilet. Even in the absence of any signs, take your puppy into the garden at regular intervals,
no matter what the weather is like, and wait patiently.
Stay with your puppy to make sure that he does not get distracted. When he does go to the toilet, give a command such as “hurry up” and praise him enthusiastically when he has finished.
The occasional house-training accident is inevitable and unless you catch your puppy in the act there is nothing you can do except clean up the mess. Never punish or scold a puppy for having an accident but if you are nearby and spot him squatting, interrupt him with a sharp noise such as clapping your hands. Your aim is to stop him in mid-flow, not to scare him. When he stops, encourage him into the garden and wait for him to perform, giving the command “hurry up”
followed by praise as described above.
Continue to take your puppy on regular toilet trips to the garden even when he has stopped having accidents. You may be able to lengthen intervals between trips, but beware the common mistake of stopping house-training as soon as your

CARE AND TRAINING

HANDLING YOUR DOG

Accustom your puppy to regular handling

Getting your dog used to being handled early on will make his day-to-day care much more pleasurable. Teach him to accept being held without protest so that you can perform routine health checks or administer occasional treatments such as ear drops. A dog that is happy to be handled is a joy to groom, and tasks such as nail clipping and tooth brushing will not be a chore or turn into a struggle.

How to handle your dog

Pet your dog by crouching down to his level and talking to him in a gentle tone. Never lean into his space. If he is willing, slowly put your hand out and stroke his chest;
avoid placing your hand directly over his head.

Make handling an opportunity for your dog to receive lots of attention, treats, and praise. Handling sessions should be frequent and fun, but keep them short so that your dog does not feel smothered. Begin by calling your dog to you and give him some gentle fuss and lots of praise when he approaches. Then practise handling him by examining his ears, eyes, mouth, paws, and tail. After each examination,
reward your dog with a treat. When you have finished, spend some more time fussing him. In the early stages, handling sessions should be no more taxing than that. If your dog appears reluctant for any part of his body to be handled, do not force him.

GOOD PRACTICE | EXAMINING YOUR DOG
LIFTING THE EARS
Get your dog used to having the inside of his ear handled. Check that the ear is its usual, dull,
pink colour with no unpleasant odour or excessive wax.

EXAMINING THE EYES
Handle the area around your dog’s eyes with great care. If the eyes need cleaning,
wipe them lightly using cotton wool moistened with warm water.

HANDLING YOUR DOG

PLENTY OF SUPPORT
When lifting both large and small dogs, support them front and back and hold them close to your body.

You may notice that he suddenly stiffens when you lift up his tail, for example, or growls when you try to pick up his paw. If this is the case, and on checking there is no sign he is hurt, use treats to gradually build up the amount of handling your dog will tolerate. Stiffening and growling are signs of aggression and, if they go unheeded, may result in a bite.
Always get advice from a professional behaviour counsellor to help a reluctant dog accept being handled.

support his front and back, praise your dog, and hold him without lifting him. Reward him with a treat for standing still. Gradually increase the length of time you hold him, before gently lifting him just off the ground.
Immediately put him down and reward him with a treat.
Small breeds and puppies are relatively easy for one person to pick up. Larger breeds, however, should not be lifted by one person alone. Any dog over 15kg (33lb) requires two people to lift it, one at the front and one at the back.
Dogs can move suddenly, causing strain to the person lifting them; they also risk being dropped, undoing hours of patient training and causing problems for the future. When you lift,
bend from the knees to avoid back injury, and check that there are no obstacles on the path to your destination.

Lifting your dog
A dog that is not used to being lifted may panic and react aggressively if you pick him up, so it is worthwhile practising lifting your dog. To begin with, simply place your hands to

INSPECTING THE TEETH
Gently lift your dog’s lips to check that the gums are pink and there are no signs of soreness. His teeth should be white and lack excessive tartar deposits.

TOUCHING THE PAWS
Check the pads for sore or broken skin,
and look in between the toes for injuries or swelling. Examine the nails and get them trimmed or clip them yourself if necessary.

GENTLE SLOPE
If lifting your dog is impractical,
a ramp is a good alternative,
particularly to help older dogs to get into a car.

LIFTING THE TAIL
Lift your dog’s tail while you tickle his stomach with your other hand. Ensure that the area below the tail is clean and that there are no signs of redness or swelling.

CARE AND TRAINING

Both dog and owner alike should find grooming an enjoyable experience. The contact encourages a strong bond to develop and is beneficial to your dog. Not only do dogs find being groomed relaxing, but it is also good for their skin and coat.
You can check your dog for lumps and bumps, parasites, and minor injuries too, while you brush him.

Learning to be groomed
Grooming is really an extended period of handling. It should not be difficult if you have taken the time to teach your dog to accept being restrained. Approach grooming as a training session. Place a towel on the floor and encourage your dog to stand still on it, in return for a treat. Calmly stroke and praise him, but do not allow him to become over-excited.
Introduce your dog to each piece of grooming equipment that you will be using regularly. Let him sniff each brush but do not allow him to chew it. Restrain him gently and move the brush through the coat on his back without pressing too hard. After a few strokes of the brush, stop and reward him with praise and a treat.

Some coat types, such as the silky coat of the
Yorkshire Terrier, are particularly prone to tangles. Silky coats need regular grooming to manage any small knots, so that they do not form uncomfortable mats.

A dog’s coat needs regular grooming – more frequently if it is a show dog

No matter what type of coat your dog has, spend time each day practising grooming and getting him used to the sensation. With a new dog, make grooming sessions very short and always reward him for standing still. Speak to him in a calm, reassuring tone and avoid tugging on tangles or knots, which may hurt him. Gradually increase the length of time you require him to stand still. Be firm from the start.
If he tries to bite the brush, do not let him turn the session into a game. Instead, gently turn his head away from the brush. He should remain standing, unless you ask him to sit or lie down so that you can reach another part of his coat.
Once he is used to standing still on the towel for an extended time, you can start a proper grooming routine.

CLIPPING NAILS
Dogs that do not regularly walk on hard surfaces, or that have long hair around their paws, need their nails clipped regularly.
Remove the pointed tip of the nail only and be careful to avoid cutting the quick.

GROOMING TOOLS
A rubber brush or glove removes shedding undercoat in smooth-coated breeds. For all other breeds, a slicker brush is the best general tool,
although a bristle brush may be preferable for long coats. Use a comb on all coat types as a finishing tool.

Work your way round
Stick to a routine when you brush your dog to ensure that no areas are missed. Start at the foot of one of his hind legs and use an appropriate tool (see above) to brush from the bottom of the coat outwards. Keep tension on the skin with your other hand, to prevent the coat from pulling painfully as you brush.
Whatever tool you use, make sure you work it right through

HAVING A BATH
Brush any knots out of your dog’s coat then wet him all over –
avoid getting water into his eyes and ears. Massage dog shampoo into his coat; never use human shampoo, as it can cause painful skin problems. Rinse the shampoo out completely before drying him thoroughly, and finish off with a good brush.

Work your way up the leg and along your dog’s side, then down the front leg to the foot and across the chest. Repeat this process on the other side, then finally brush the tail and around your dog’s head.
Mats can form in a dog’s long coat when loose underhairs wrap together or when the coat tangles. Matting that occurs in movement spots, such as the armpits, can be very painful.
To deal with mats, you need a de-matting comb to break up the clumps so that they can be removed with a brush.

COAT CLIPPING
Clipping the coat is the usual practice for many breeds. Find a professional dog groomer who can do this for you. A good groomer will not rush a new dog and will spend time getting him used to the sound and feel of the clippers, using treats to help him feel comfortable.

CARE AND TRAINING

GOOD BEHAVIOUR
A well-mannered dog is not only a pleasure to live with but is also happier. If your dog understands the house rules, he will stay out of trouble and can take part in family activities and greet visitors. Preventing bad habits from forming is much easier than trying to undo them later on, so start teaching your new dog how to behave as soon as he arrives in your home.

Where to rest
Although it is tempting to allow a new puppy on to the furniture and into your bed when he is very small, you may not want this to happen when he is much bigger, hairier, and dirtier. Changing the rules as your puppy grows up is unfair,
so it is best to decide at the start which rooms he can go in and whether he can sit on the sofa. Make sure that the whole family agrees and treats the puppy consistently.
It is very important to give your dog a private corner to relax in on his own, but he may need encouragement to use it. At the times in the day when your dog normally goes

QUIET CORNER
To encourage your dog to go to his bed, give him a treat or chew to take with him. When he goes to his bed, offer gentle praise and encouragement.

to sleep, coax him on to his bed with a gentle cue such as
“go to bed”. Spend some time there with him, gently stroking him and quietly praising him as he falls asleep. Should he take himself to his bed of his own accord, praise him quietly or toss a treat so that it lands just in front of his nose.

TRAINING | GETTING OFF THE FURNITURE

When your dog jumps off the furniture, clearly give the command “off” and praise him. Guide him to his bed and settle him there with praise and treats.

A light, long lead makes it easier to teach your dog to get off the furniture. Use this in the early stages of training when he does not yet understand the appropriate voice cue. If he sits on a forbidden chair or sofa,
pick up the long lead and ask him to get off.

If encouragement and putting gentle pressure on the long lead fail to make him get down, do not use the lead to drag your dog off the furniture. If he does not jump off immediately, use a toy or a treat to encourage him further.

G O O D B E H AV I O U R

TRAINING | NO JUMPING UP

If your dog jumps up, remove all attention by turning your back and folding your arms. Avoid eye contact and do not speak to him until he stops.

When your dog has all four feet on the ground, reward him with lots of fuss in the form of praise, treats, and play. If he gets too excited and jumps up again, turn away immediately.
He will quickly learn that keeping all four paws on the ground is the key to getting attention.

Good manners
Puppies often receive the most attention from people when they are jumping up or barking, so understandably they often continue to use the same technique as they get older,
when such behaviour is less appealing. It is not wise to allow even the smallest dog to jump up at anyone, because a boisterous dog can scare people, especially young children,
or even cause injuries.
For a dog to learn good manners, he must not receive any attention at all when he is jumping up or barking. This does not just mean withholding praise – to some dogs, being shouted at or pushed away counts as satisfactory attention.
Ignore your dog completely to teach him that when he is sitting quietly, people come to him and lavish him with praise and treats.
GREETING VISITORS
Dogs can get over-excited when visitors call. Control your dog with a long lead to make sure that he is behaving politely before you let visitors say hello.

CARE AND TRAINING

PLAY-BITING
If your puppy is a persistent play-biter, keep a soft toy nearby to grab quickly whenever you spend time playing with him. Use a big toy so that you can hold on to it without needing to put your hands too close to your dog’s teeth.

Teething troubles
Dogs investigate the world with their mouths. Young dogs, in particular, want to chew everything they come across to find out more about it. This habit often becomes more pronounced at around four months of age, when puppies begin to lose their first teeth. It is natural for puppies to play-bite their litter mates but they must learn never to use their teeth on humans in the same way. This lesson is an important part of teaching a young dog good manners. When your puppy play-bites at your hand, form a fist to make it harder for him to chew and offer him a soft toy instead. Engage him with the toy and have a good game with him,
but stop if his teeth touch your hand.
Either get up immediately and walk away to indicate the game has ended or keep your hand still and let out a yelp as another puppy would do.

TRAINING | TAKING FOOD GENTLY

Hold a tasty treat firmly in your fist and show it to your dog. Keep your fist still as he tries to get the treat, but do not open it if he is touching your hand or chewing or pawing it.

When your puppy moves away from your hand, even for a moment, open your fist and allow him to take the treat.
This will teach him not to snatch food but to wait for it calmly.

G O O D B E H AV I O U R

TRAINING | GIVING UP CHEWS

Once he has eaten the treat, immediately give him back the chew. Repeat the lesson at intervals. It won’t be long before your dog learns to give up his chews happily.

When your dog has been enjoying a chew for a while, approach calmly with a really smelly treat. Get close enough for him to smell it and use it to lure him away from his chew.

As he moves away from his chew, give him the smelly treat and at the same time calmly pick up the chew with your other hand. Use the treat to keep him distracted.

Preventing food aggression
Dogs can be very possessive about their food and many will guard it against anyone who approaches. Although perfectly normal canine behaviour, it is not tolerable in a pet dog and must be discouraged at a very early stage. Training a dog not to be aggressive about food is easy. Simply teach your puppy to expect that anyone who approaches him while he is eating will have something even tastier to offer. When you

give your puppy his food, crouch down beside him and gently stroke and talk to him as he eats. Offer him some really tasty treats, such as cooked chicken or cheese, and allow him to take them from you. If he is comfortable with this, progress by putting your hand into his food bowl and letting him take the treat from there. Repeat this once or twice before leaving him to finish his meal. If you approach and your puppy looks up expectantly, lift up his bowl and place some tasty treats in it before returning it to him straight away.
Once his response is absolutely predictable, get a variety of different people, including children, to repeat the procedure.
As the puppy grows up, repeat this training less frequently but do not stop completely until your dog is fully mature.
A dog that has already developed aggression around food poses a genuine risk and will bite anyone who gets too close. Do not attempt to treat this problem without the advice of a professional behaviour counsellor.

Offering your dog a treat on the flat of your hand prevents him from accidentally catching you with his teeth. Make sure that friends and children offering him treats are taught this rule.

CARE AND TRAINING

Playtime
As highly social animals, dogs need interaction with both other dogs and people as much as they need physical and mental exercise. Play can offer this interaction and helps dogs to mature properly, so it is essential that they have as much of it as they need. However, it is during playtime that your dog is most likely to become over-excited and start misbehaving. Teach your puppy the rules of play, both with you and with other dogs. He must also learn to stop playing when you tell him to.
Use toys to help your dog learn that play with people is different from play-fighting with other dogs. Playtime should begin and end with a display of good manners, such as a sit.
If your puppy gets over-excited, call a halt to the fun until he calms down. Don’t restrain him with your hands during play as he will probably try to mouth you or jump up. It may be useful to keep a puppy on a light, long lead during playtime.
This allows you to calm him down without offering the temptation of your hands. If this does not work, simply walk away from your puppy, making it clear that the game is over.
TUG-OF-WAR
Tug games are a great way to interact with your dog, as long as you can control when the game begins and when it ends.

TOP TIPS
■ Your dog should be taught from an early age not to be possessive of his toys.
It is understandable that any dog would want to guard a prized possession from human hands, but this can lead to snapping and biting. Spend time trading toys for treats until your dog learns that allowing people to pick up his toys leads to a tasty reward. Teach children that snatching something quickly away from a dog may startle him and possibly arouse aggression.

THRILL OF
THE CHASE
Many dogs love chasing toys that fly through the air. Keep your puppy on a long lead until he understands the rules.

GOOD PRACTICE | PLAYING

RESPONDING TO A NEW TOY
Allow your puppy to nibble a new toy to find out whether it tastes nice and to check whether it will bite back.

Do not be alarmed if your puppy growls — he is simply treating the toy like another puppy.
This is normal playfulness, not aggression.

GIVING UP A TOY
Occasionally take the toy away from your puppy and praise him before returning it. If he is reluctant to give it up, swap it for a treat.

G O O D B E H AV I O U R

Barking
Often puppies will “find their voice” at around six months of age. Puppy-yapping can be amusing and although it is tempting to encourage this new behaviour, it is not advisable.
As your puppy matures, both you and your neighbours will become weary of persistent barking. If your puppy is prone to barking at certain moments of high excitement — for example, during a game — then use a lead to control his behaviour. Give him what he wants only when he is quiet.
If your puppy tends to bark excitedly when you are about to do something, such as prepare his dinner or get ready for a walk, stop what you are doing until he is quiet. If necessary, sit down calmly on the sofa until he has stopped barking completely. It is worth spending a few extra minutes getting your puppy calm before going out of the door for a walk. Your puppy will realize quickly that barking is completely counter-productive when it comes to getting what he wants, whereas waiting quietly is always rewarded.
OVER-EXCITEMENT
If your puppy barks when you are about to go for a walk, ignore it and he will learn that staying quiet is a quicker way to get what he wants.

ATTENTION SEEKING
Barking to gain attention should not be rewarded. Ignore your dog until he is silent or walk away from him, returning with lavish praise when he is quiet.

ON GUARD
Your dog may use barking as an alert signal when the post arrives. He should not be told off for this, but do not let alarm barking continue for long.

CARE AND TRAINING

Whatever your young puppy experiences will affect the way he responds to the world as an adult dog. At an early age, introduce him to everything he is likely to encounter, from different people and other dogs, to cars and vacuum cleaners. This process, called socialization, is the single most important task you can undertake to ensure that your puppy grows into a friendly family pet.

Understanding your dog
Socialization must begin with an understanding of how dogs interact with their surroundings. A puppy views the world very differently from humans. Whereas we rely on our eyes to get information about the world, dogs place much more reliance on their sense of smell. A new puppy learns about things more quickly by smelling and chewing them than by looking at them. In fact, dogs cannot see the same amount of detail as humans or distinguish red from green, but their

Everyone’s friend

night vision is far superior to ours. Dogs have a much more acute sense of hearing than humans. This means a noise that is seemingly inconsequential to us may sound loud and scary to a dog.
Puppies go through a series of developmental stages as they mature. These stages are windows of opportunity for socialization, and positive experiences during such times will help to shape your puppy into a happy and balanced adult dog. In his first weeks your puppy is still inquisitive,

full of play, eager to please, and also less inclined to be wary of new and unusual things than he will be later on. Some socialization may have happened while your puppy was with the breeder. This is important as the period at which socialization becomes most critical is, broadly speaking,
between 8–12 weeks of age, and you may not pick your puppy up until he is about that age. Once you have brought your puppy home, socialization must continue. Anything that he does not come across during his formative period and make a positive association with, will be looked upon with distrust or fear if he meets it as an adult. It is important not to miss this deadline, so introduce your puppy to your friends and their children. Having contact with toddlers and older people is particularly important. Once fully vaccinated, take him out to meet other animals, go for a bus ride, and visit the park to look at the ducks. Socialize your puppy early and socialize him well; you will find it a rewarding and joyful experience.

MAKING NEW FRIENDS
Meeting a variety of other animals, both large and small,
will give your puppy confidence.

Dogs need to learn how to interact with other dogs at the earliest opportunity. A puppy that is not socialized correctly will grow up becoming more and more fearful of other dogs,
and this usually leads to aggression. Puppies learn best about getting on with other dogs by playing with puppies

of their own age. During play,
dogs discover how to read each other’s body language and how to respond appropriately.
They also learn how to display friendliness as well as how to judge whether another dog is friendly.
Adult dogs can also be very good at teaching puppies how to behave. Make sure that all the adult dogs your puppy meets are friendly and well socialized themselves. It can be difficult to stick to this rule if you take your puppy into public spaces,
so stay vigilant and move away quickly from potential trouble.
A negative experience at this tender age could be enough to make your puppy wary of other dogs for life. A good puppy class should include interactions with “safe” adult dogs.
By taking care that all your puppy’s experiences with other dogs are positive, you ensure that he has no reason to be afraid in later life.

HIGHLY PERCEPTIVE
Dogs do not have our acute vision but they are good at detecting movement, however slight. This allows them to predict our movements,
sometimes before we are conscious of them ourselves.

PUPPY CLASS
A well-organized puppy class will be of great benefit to your puppy. Look for classes that use only reward-based methods and have only a few puppies playing together at any one time.

Getting used to other dogs

CARE AND TRAINING

Meeting the family
If your puppy is to become a polite and confident dog, you must introduce him to a variety of different people. Puppies soon make friends with all the members of their family but some of them are shy with strangers. Invite visitors of all ages, male and female, to your home, to meet your puppy.
Show your visitors how to interact with your puppy but do not let them overwhelm him. Instead, ask them to wait for the puppy to make the first approach before greeting him.
When the puppy does come to them, make sure that your visitors give him plenty of treats and gentle attention.
Give your puppy plenty of experiences with children early on so that he becomes used to them, and teach your children how to behave around dogs. Interactions between your dog

and children should always be supervised, as children’s sudden movements and noises can sometimes startle young puppies.
However, do not shy away from such encounters – taking a new puppy to the school gate when you drop off and pick up your children is a great way to socialize him with children of all ages. Using lots of praise and tasty treats on these visits will guarantee that your puppy remembers the experiences fondly.
Take the time to meet and greet all kinds of different people when you are outside the house with your puppy. Ask joggers and cyclists to stop and say hello to your puppy if he seems to be alarmed by their fast movement. If people are willing and able, get them to crouch down with a treat and wait for him to approach for his reward.

YOUNG PLAYMATE
Children and dogs can become the best of friends, but they need time to get used to one another.

NEW ARRIVAL
Introduce babies and dogs gradually and never leave them alone together.
Begin by getting your dog used to the smell of your baby’s clothes.

FELINE INTRODUCTION
Introduce a cat by holding your dog to prevent him from chasing it. The cat must be free to escape if it feels threatened.

S O C I A L I Z AT I O N
STRANGE SOUNDS
Introduce noisy objects like vacuum cleaners slowly and with lots of treats. Get your dog used to the movement of the vacuum before turning it on.

New sights and sounds
In addition to other dogs and people, puppies need to get used to the many strange objects they will encounter during their lifetime. Washing machines, coffee grinders, lawnmowers,
vacuum cleaners, tumble dryers, and cars are all examples of objects that are big, loud, and scary to a young puppy. It is important to take the time to actively seek out these things and allow your puppy to get accustomed to them at his own pace. Do not force him to investigate them – instead, set up situations where he can observe the object from a distance and allow him to approach when he feels more confident.
Take treats with you wherever you go; make each new experience fun by playing games with your puppy, and rewarding him generously. Watch your puppy closely. If certain objects or experiences disturb him, don’t avoid them but gradually familiarize him with them so that he learns not to react negatively. During these more stressful situations distract him with a toy and talk to him until he forgets his nerves. Once he relaxes, you can encourage him to move closer.
ONCOMING VEHICLE
Allow your puppy to get used to cars at his own pace,
using treats to reinforce calm behaviour. He will lose fear once he accepts they are background objects.

If your puppy chases vehicles or livestock he may get injured, so discourage this behaviour from the start and get professional guidance if needed.
TROUBLE AHEAD
When you see a cyclist or jogger approaching,
encourage your puppy to sit quietly. Once they have passed reward him with treats.

CARE AND TRAINING

Car travel
For a young dog, car travel is a very strange experience at first and he needs time to get used to it. Puppies are usually wary of car rides because the first two trips they go on are when they are taken away from their mother and their first visit to the vet. Neither are very pleasant occasions and can leave many dogs with negative feelings about cars. Spending time rebalancing the way your puppy views the car will prevent travelling problems in the future.
Encourage your dog to investigate the car when the engine is turned off. Get him used to the sound of car doors opening and closing and to the feeling of being in a car.
Spend time simply sitting in the car with your dog, or leave him there to sleep, so that he begins to see it as a great place to be. Put him in the place where he will be travelling in the future. For example, if you plan to travel with your dog in a car crate, that is where he should be placed from the start.
When you take your dog on a car journey, make sure he relieves himself before you set off. To begin with, go on lots of short trips that end with something enjoyable like a walk in the woods. By associating car journeys with positive endings, your puppy will soon forget the earlier trips that caused such distress. Over time, gradually increase the length of the journeys as your dog becomes happier and more relaxed in the car.

STRAPPED IN
Restraining your dog while he is in the car is essential. It stops him from interfering with the driver or other passengers and prevents him from being thrown around in the car during the journey.

TRAINING | SUCCESSFUL JOURNEYS

Before your dog does any travelling, he should learn that cars are fun. Take time to play with him in and around the car and even feed him his dinner in the car.

Until your dog is big enough to jump into the car without hurting himself, lift him in and be ready to prevent him from trying to jump out again. Settle him in the car by staying with him, praising him, and giving him lots of treats.

A travelling crate is a good way of keeping your dog contained and feeling secure. Dogs that are already used to sleeping in a cage or crate will find this particularly reassuring.

Travel sickness
Many dogs suffer from travel sickness as they find it difficult to adjust to the unnatural movement of a car journey. In fact,
many problems experienced while travelling with a dog, such as excessive barking or panting, are due to underlying travel sickness making the dog restless. It is possible for many dogs to get over this with time. However, there may also be a psychological element involved, so think about whether your dog has good or bad feelings about the car. If you have a rescue dog, his previous experiences with cars may be unknown so stopping him from being sick may be more difficult. Treat a dog that is habitually travel-sick in the same way you would a dog who has never travelled before. Spend
TOP TIPS
■ Help prevent car sickness by making sure your dog has a non-slip surface if he stands up in the car. Take corners slowly and accelerate smoothly.
■ Even on a cool day, dogs can quickly overheat in a car,
so never leave your dog alone in the car for very long.

SAFETY FIRST
Insist that your dog waits until he is asked to get out of the car.
He should never jump out as soon as the door opens, as one day he may jump into the road. Restrain him if necessary and praise him for waiting calmly. Teach him to wait for just a few moments at first, gradually extending the length of time.

time with him, making a positive association with the car. Keep the engine off, play games around the car, and use lots of treats. When your dog is relaxed in the car, turn the engine on briefly and then play with him. For your first journey with your dog, just go to the end of the road before stopping for more games and treats. In extreme cases, consult your vet.
THIRSTY PASSENGER
The car is one of the few places where your dog may not have free access to water. Be sure to stop regularly to offer him a drink and to relieve himself; he may be more thirsty than usual due to the heat inside the car.

CONTENTED DOG
Take your dog for a walk before leaving him. If he is tired and content, he is likely to accept being left alone and will curl up and go to sleep.

S O C I A L I Z AT I O N

Learning to be left alone
Everyone wants to spend a great deal of time with a new puppy in the first few weeks after his arrival. The general fuss and attention, combined with socialization, usually mean that the puppy is never alone for more than a few of his waking moments. As he gets older and stops receiving such constant attention, he may become anxious at being left alone. Part of his socialization should include teaching him to accept being on his own.
Choose a time when your puppy is ready for sleep. Take him outside to relieve himself before guiding him to his bed and calmly leaving the room. Shut the door behind you and ignore whining and barking until he gives up and falls asleep.
This exercise should be repeated until the puppy has learned to settle quietly on his own for a few hours.
Puppies should be discouraged from following their owners around everywhere they go. Make a point of shutting doors behind you as you move around the house so that your puppy cannot always come with you. At first, go back to him quickly and reassure him, so that he knows he has not been abandoned and that you never stay away for long. He will soon learn that there is no need to become worried or nervous at being left alone.
Never tell your dog off for something that has happened in your absence. If you leave your puppy for half an hour and return to find he has chewed his blanket, do not punish him. Dogs associate events that occur very close together:
scolding your puppy will teach him to be afraid of you coming home, not that chewing a blanket is wrong.
SEPARATION ANXIETY
When dogs are really worried they can work out their anxiety by chewing whatever is nearby,
including furniture and other possessions. This is a sign that your dog is not coping with being left alone for long periods.

TOP TIPS
■ Early on in your puppy’s training, get him comfortable with being alone. Set aside periods during the day where you leave him for a short time.
He will rapidly gain confidence.

GRADUAL SEPARATION
Use a stair gate to help an anxious dog build up to full separation. He will be reassured by seeing and hearing you, even if he cannot follow.

Anxiety in the older dog
A mature dog that has never been acclimatized to being left alone may become extremely anxious on his own. Scratching at doorways, panting and pacing, howling, and lapses in toilet training are all signs of a dog that is struggling to cope with being left alone. The damage caused by an anxious dog can be expensive to repair, and there is also a danger that the dog may injure himself.
Deep-rooted separation anxiety can be tricky to overcome.
Some dogs are so anxious that they panic at the mere sight of their owner picking up the keys. Long-standing cases may require assistance from a professional behaviour counsellor and, in the short term, possibly medication to calm the dog down enough to concentrate on learning new lessons.
Socialization consists of patiently going back to basics and, to begin with, getting your dog used to being left alone for a few seconds at a time. You can then gradually build up to longer periods of separation.

CARE AND TRAINING

TRAINING YOUR DOG
To enjoy spending time with your dog, both in the house and outdoors, you need to train him to be well behaved. Training strengthens the bond between the two of you, and provides your dog with some of the mental stimulation he craves. If you learn how to communicate with your dog and read his body language,
it will make teaching him much easier and more satisfying.
Communicating with your dog
Dogs and people have very different ways of communicating with each other. Although dogs become quite good at interpreting what people mean, successful training depends on people learning to “talk dog”.
A dog does not understand language; he merely responds to different sounds. “Lie”
and “down” may mean the same thing to humans but they sound quite different to dogs.
So you should choose a simple verbal cue for each command and stick to it. Tone of voice also matters; puppies learn quickly that a low,
growly voice means they are doing something

INVITING GESTURE
Facing your dog and crouching down with open arms is a positive signal. Any time you face your dog directly, you are inviting interaction.

wrong and that treats and fuss usually follow a cheery tone.
Most important of all is body language. Eye contact is a vital part of communicating with your dog, but remember that a prolonged stare can be seen as a threat. Dogs do not immediately understand hand movements, such as pointing;
they have to learn to make an association between what your hand does and what they must do to earn a reward.

HAND SIGNALS
Your dog will probably recognize your hand signals before he learns what the voice cue means. It is important to be as consistent with your hand signals as with your voice cues.

VOICE CUES
With repetition, your dog learns that certain words mean he should perform certain behaviours. A good test to see if your dog has learned the voice cue properly is to see if he will respond to your voice, even if you turn your back to him.

TRAINING YOUR DOG

Reading a dog’s body language
Being able to interpret your dog’s body language means you will have a clearer idea of what he is feeling. You cannot train a dog effectively until you have learned to read the signs that tell you when he is happy or when he is scared. When dogs are stressed, it is impossible for them to concentrate on learning. If your dog is not responding well to training,
it is important to stop the session straight away and try to analyse what is going wrong.
A relaxed dog shows no signs of tension and will hold his tail roughly level with his back and gently swinging. The ears will most likely be forward and the expression calm. A
frightened or anxious dog tucks his tail in between his back legs and pulls his ears back. You may also notice that the dog is tensing his body or cowering. Other signs of fear or anxiety include excessive panting, pacing, or a sudden disinterest in food. A scared dog needs help to work through his worries and should never be punished, as this will only increase his anxiety.
You can also learn a lot about canine body language by observing what happens when your dog meets another.
If your dog raises his hackles along his back and carries his tail straight up in the air, it means that he is worried and is trying to make himself appear as large as possible. This body language normally changes as the dogs exchange greetings and, if the other dog is friendly, the initial tension passes.
However, raised hackles may also be the prelude to trouble if both dogs decide they do not like one another.

Dogs have many subtle ways of showing that they are feeling anxious or afraid. Signs include yawning or acting sleepy when the dog has no reason to be tired.

RELAXED DOG
A happy, confident dog will move in a relaxed manner. Any sign of tension, evident in a stiffening of the body, is a warning that he feels uncomfortable. Pay attention to his tail carriage. A tail held erect may suggest over-excitement or aggression, while a tucked-under tail suggests fear and anxiety.

LICKING NOSE
A dog that repeatedly licks his nose or lips,
even though there is no tempting food nearby, may be trying to communicate fear, anxiety, or stress.

TURNING HEAD AWAY
Dogs sometimes indicate unease by turning their head or whole body away, to break eye contact and distance themselves from what they perceive as a threat.

CARE AND TRAINING

Rewards-based training
There has been a great deal of research into the best methods for training dogs. The results show that resorting to harsh punishments for disobedience, such as using a choke chain, shouting and hitting a dog, or pinning him down, is simply not effective. Such treatment is likely to cause more problem behaviours, including aggression and anxiety. The most successful way to train a dog is to find out what motivates him and use that to reward him for behaving in the way you want.
To do this, you need to find out what works with your own dog. All dogs are individuals and react differently to rewards,
but there are some common motivators that can be used as training aids for the majority of dogs. Simple praise is a very effective reward for a young puppy. Dogs are sociable animals and find positive contact with people in their family unit deeply rewarding. Most dogs will happily do what you ask of them in return for praise.
However, for some dogs the situation in which they find themselves can be so distracting that the desire to please may temporarily be taken over by more impelling urges.

FAVOURITE TOY
Many dogs are motivated by toys. If your dog loves to play,
keep his favourite toy aside and bring it out only as a reward during training.

For instance, your dog may choose to ignore your calls when he is running after a rabbit. This is not because he no longer loves or respects you; it is simply that for a few thrilling moments he finds the unusual excitement of the chase more rewarding than your praise, which is always on offer. To overcome such distractions during training, you must find other things that are particularly rewarding to your dog. The most powerful motivators used in dog training are toys and food. Use something that your dog really loves and will therefore be strongly motivated to receive.

USING PRAISE
One of the best forms of reward is praise. This requires no training aids – you simply have to make a big fuss of your dog. Talk to him in a friendly tone and stroke him.
MOTIVATING FOOD
All dogs find food motivating. Treats used for training should be small, bite-sized pieces of a food that is particularly tasty to your dog. Go for healthy choices such as cooked chicken or cheese.

TIMING REWARDS
Giving rewards too slowly may make your dog learn the wrong thing. If his attention is distracted,
by the time he receives the reward, he may not make the connection between it and adopting the desired “sit” position (see above). Be prepared to give your dog his reward as soon as he follows your command (see right), and he will learn very quickly.

The importance of timing
Probably the most important skill for you to master as a dog trainer is good timing. Dogs learn exclusively by association.
This means that if they do something and immediately receive a reward, they are more likely to repeat that behaviour. Of course, this also causes some behaviour problems. For example, if a dog that wants attention jumps up and gets pushed off or shouted at, he has received the attention he wants. Effectively, he has been rewarded for jumping up and is therefore more likely to jump up again.
If this is repeated, jumping up becomes a learned behaviour
– one that is repeated frequently.
Nevertheless, the way that dogs make associations is also extremely useful in teaching them how they should behave. If every time your dog sits he receives a food treat immediately afterwards, he will start sitting more frequently.
An association has been made between the behaviour of

sitting and a reward. It is then fairly simple to insert a voice cue as he folds into a sit, creating a learned behaviour that your dog will produce on command. However, if you keep your food treats in your pocket and take a few moments to get them out, your dog will have sat, got bored, and jumped up at you by the time he gets the treat. Again, he learns that jumping up is a rewarding behaviour and will therefore repeat it more often.
SLEEP TIME
Your puppy will learn better if he sleeps between lessons. A young puppy tires easily, so keep training sessions short with frequent breaks.

CARE AND TRAINING

Basic commands
Sitting is a behaviour that comes quite naturally to puppies and is therefore a good place to start formal training. It is a very easy command for a puppy to learn and gives him a guaranteed way of earning a reward. Because of this, most puppies will offer a sit as the first option, when there is a reward available. As your dog gets older and a sit becomes less exceptional, the behaviour is less likely to be rewarded,
so he will try other methods to get noticed, such as jumping up or barking. Keep rewarding your dog whenever he offers a sit, to reinforce the calm behaviour you want from him.
Teaching a puppy to lie down can be more difficult than getting him to sit, but this is probably the most useful of all the basic positions for your dog to learn. Lying down is a more stable position than sitting, meaning that a dog is less likely to move again immediately afterwards. Having a reliable “down” command can be vital in emergencies when you need to stop your dog on the spot – for example, if he is running towards a road. Lying down also reinforces a relaxed state of mind and can help to calm a puppy in an exciting situation. Make it one of your puppy’s earliest lessons, as the
“down” command comes in handy if he becomes distracted during a training session and stops paying attention.

AT THE ROADSIDE
Put the sit command into practice whenever you need control over your dog. For example, asking a puppy to sit at every roadside will teach him not to walk straight into traffic
(it is not always possible to shorten a lead in time to prevent mishap). Remember to practise sitting at every roadside you come to – not just at main roads.
Your puppy cannot tell what type of road he is approaching.

Start teaching your puppy to lie down when he is highly motivated. For example, if you carry out a training session just before a meal, when he is hungry, he will be more receptive to what you ask because he will be eager for food treats. Encourage him by starting on a soft surface, such as carpet or grass, before moving on to harder, less comfortable surfaces. As with all your commands, be very precise about the meaning of each word. If your command to lie down is
“down”, then do not use the word “down” to ask your puppy to get off your furniture.

TRAINING | SIT

With your dog standing in front of you, hold a treat right in front of his nose and slowly move your hand up and backwards,
close over his head.
Do not let go of the treat immediately.

As your dog’s nose moves up to follow the treat,
he will have to place his bottom on the floor. Ask him to
“sit” and as soon as his bottom is down, let him take the treat and praise him. Continue to praise him for as long as he is sitting.

Once your puppy is reliably performing a sit every time food is lured over his head, move on to giving a clear hand signal while asking him to “sit”.
Then bend down and lure him into position as before.

TRAINING YOUR DOG

TRAINING | DOWN

In a distraction-free environment, such as your back garden, attract your dog’s attention by showing him that you have a tasty treat.
Use the treat to lure your dog into a sitting position but do not let him take it from you.

Move the treat from his nose in a straight line to the ground.
Do this slowly so that your dog’s nose follows your hand, but still hold on to the treat. Let him nibble at the treat so that he does not lose interest.
Alternative If your puppy is reluctant to lie down, another method can be used. Make a bridge with your legs and lure him underneath. Use lots of treats and keep your legs positioned over him until he is lying down.

As your dog follows the treat, he will gradually fold into a lying position. Once he is fully down, let go of the treat and praise him. Give the command “down” as his elbows touch the ground.

CARE AND TRAINING

More advanced commands
Teaching your dog a command that means “stay there and wait for me to come back to you” is useful in any number of situations. This command works well for everyday use, both in the house and on walks, but it can also be helpful in other more difficult situations. For example, if your dog escapes and runs across a road, you will want him to wait where he is, rather than recrossing the road and putting himself in danger again. Your dog’s natural instinct is to follow you,
so when you want him to stay in a particular position, it will make training easier if you turn sideways to him and avoid eye contact. By doing this he doesn’t think you are communicating with him and will therefore be less likely to move towards you.
All dogs need to learn to walk on a lead, and must do so without pulling, if going for walks is to be an enjoyable experience and not a constant battle. Puppies do not instantly understand what a lead is for and it is natural for them to pull in an attempt to reach an exciting destination sooner. If they learn from the start that pulling on the lead is never successful, they will soon stop trying. Make sure that whenever your puppy pulls, you either stop and wait until he stops, or call him back to the correct heel position.

RESISTING TEMPTATION
The “stay” command can be used to teach your dog to ignore food and other temptations. Reward your dog for staying away from human food by giving him a more suitable treat.

TRAINING | WALK ON A LEAD

Start your session in an area where there are few distractions. Keeping your dog on a long lead, lure him into the correct position next to your left leg by offering a food treat.
Praise him when he is in the correct position by letting him take the treat.

Before your dog starts to lose interest and attempts to wander off, show him that you have another treat but hold it out of his reach. Use his name to keep his attention and do not allow the lead to tighten as you get ready to move.

Take a step forward and give your dog the command “heel”. Immediately bend down and give him a treat. Repeat this exercise, taking single steps, stopping, and quickly pulling out another treat so that your dog does not get distracted.

TRAINING YOUR DOG

TRAINING | STAY

When your dog will stay in front of you for some time, take a step away from him before rewarding him. Repeat,
gradually extending the time before the reward.
Once he is confident with you one pace away,
increase the distance.

Ask your dog to “sit”.
Stand up straight, then immediately bend down to reward him with a food treat. Next time, stand up straight and count to two before rewarding him.
Gradually extend the amount of time between the sit and the reward.

As your dog becomes more confident and attentive, begin increasing the number of steps before he receives a treat. Do this very gradually, praising him all the time. As soon as the lead tightens, stop and lure him back into position before starting off again.

WALKING TO HEEL
It may not be necessary for your dog to walk precisely to heel at all times, as long as he does not pull on his lead. However,
sometimes it is useful to keep your dog close
– for example, when walking past people on the pavement. Use a similar method to that used to teach long-lead walking (left), keeping your dog in position by using a treat. Once your dog is reliably walking close to you, gradually phase out the treat.

CARE AND TRAINING

Returning on cue
All dogs love being able to go to the park or out into the country where they can run free, really stretching their legs and playing with toys or other dogs. However, until your dog has learned to return when you call, it is not safe to let him off his lead. You may come across someone who is nervous around dogs, or perhaps encounter another dog that is not friendly. Your dog may catch sight of a rabbit or squirrel and run after it towards a road. No matter what the distraction,
part of responsible dog-ownership is keeping your dog under control – even when he is off-lead. Teaching your dog to come when he is called is imperative.
Puppies are born with a natural instinct to follow, and they never want to be far from you. This makes it easy to get your puppy used to the meaning of the word “come” at an early age. When your puppy is a short distance away from you,
crouch down and throw your arms wide, calling his name. As he hurtles towards you, tell him he is a good boy and insert your cue “come”. Always reward him with an extra special treat for coming when he is called, so that he knows it is worthwhile. As he gets older and more independent, he will be less keen to run straight to you and more likely to continue investigating whatever else has caught his attention. On your first walks with your dog, teach him on a lead to come when called, until you are confident he will respond every time.

TOP TIPS
■ Always praise your dog for coming when called, no matter how long it has taken him.
Resist the urge to tell him off for taking his time; it will only make him reluctant to return in future.
■ Using a whistle as your recall command can be useful as it is a very clear noise that travels a long way.

When he responds well on the lead, switch to an extending lead and practise the command before letting him off completely.
Find a safe place to experiment with this stage.
Teaching your dog to fetch a toy is a great way to reinforce the command “come” through play. When your dog has reached a toy you have thrown, he will want to bring it back to you so that you can throw it for him again. Asking him to
“come” as he naturally returns to you helps him learn this command. Teaching your dog to fetch properly will also prevent him from developing problem behaviours, such as stealing items and running off.

TRAINING | COME WHEN CALLED

Show your dog that you have a really tasty treat in your hand before moving a short distance away. If your dog will not wait,
ask someone else to gently hold on to the end of his lead.

Turn and face your dog, crouch down, and spread your arms wide. In a loud, cheery voice call your dog’s name and ask him to “come”. Keep calling until he responds.

TRAINING YOUR DOG

TRAINING | FETCH

As soon as your dog moves towards you, encourage him by crouching down and praising him. Exchange his toy for a treat and repeat the process.

Get your dog excited by playing with him and his favourite toy. When he is fully focused on the toy, throw it a short distance away.

As he heads to his toy,
ask him to “fetch”. When he reaches it, praise him before immediately calling him in a cheery tone.

If your dog drops the toy, run over to it with him and move it to catch his interest.
As he grabs it, walk backwards a few paces before taking the toy from him.

When he is right next to you, prevent him from immediately running off again by gently taking hold of his collar before giving him the treat and lots of praise.

As soon as your dog moves towards you, praise him lavishly and keep praising him as he returns. Show him the treat and use it to lure him close to you.

CARE AND TRAINING

It is your responsibility to keep your dog as fit and healthy as possible throughout his life. You should learn the basic facts about health care and how to recognize when a trip to the vet is necessary. Make sure that your puppy is happy and relaxed at the vet’s surgery from an early age – this is important preparation for stress-free visits later on.

Meeting the vet
Even before you bring a new puppy home you should register with a local veterinary surgery. Visit several surgeries to ask questions and make comparisons, and ask other dog owners,
who are likely to be a good source of recommendations. Once you have your new puppy, it is advisable to take him to the vet as soon as possible for a full health check and vaccinations.
This is also a good opportunity to seek advice on such matters as feeding and local puppy classes.
Although veterinary surgeries are strange places, full of unusual smells and noises,

fearful of vets. If your puppy’s first few visits to the vet’s surgery are largely pleasant experiences, full of treats and cuddles, he is less likely to object to the occasional injection and won’t become stressed when later visits are necessary.
The surgery may allow you to make a social visit with your puppy even if you don’t have an appointment. Ask a nurse or receptionist to give your puppy some treats so that he makes a positive association with both the building and the people in it.
On your first official visit to the vet, arrive early having given your puppy the chance to relieve himself before leaving home. When you enter the surgery, be aware of other animals, and do not assume that all dogs will be pleased to see a puppy. However, there will

EARLY ENCOUNTER
Your puppy’s first visit to the vet is as much about socialization as it is about getting a health check. Try to ensure that it is a pleasant experience.

Typically, puppies have their first vaccinations with the breeder and will need a second vaccination shortly after moving to a new home.

be many people keen to take an interest in your puppy,
so ask them to make a fuss of him, but don’t put him down on the floor unless he has been fully vaccinated.
During the consultation, your vet will want to examine your puppy all over and give him an injection. Take the process slowly, speak reassuringly to your puppy, and provide him with lots of treats throughout the examination,
both from your hand and the vet’s.

NEUTERED DOGS
Most owners have their pet dogs neutered to prevent accidental matings and unwanted puppies. Your vet can advise you on the best time to get this done.

Microchip

Syringe used to implant microchip

Preventative measures
If your puppy has not already been microchipped by the breeder, ask your vet to do this for you. Although your puppy should wear a collar and tag at all times, having a microchip means he is identifiable even if he loses his collar. Get your vet to check the microchip’s location every year when your dog gets his booster vaccinations.
In between routine visits to your vet you need to take steps to protect your dog against common parasites. There are a variety of highly effective worming and flea treatments available; your vet will advise which are best for your puppy.
Unless you intend to breed from your dog you may want to discuss neutering on one of your early visits. Apart from unwanted pregnancies, female dogs benefit from a reduced risk of life-threatening conditions, such as mammary cancer and pyometra (pus in the womb). Neutered males are less likely to be aggressive and to go wandering. Your vet will fully explain the advantages and disadvantages of the procedure and recommend when to have it done if you decide to go ahead. Neutering is carried out under anaesthetic, so ask about post-operative care of your dog (see p.333).

Microchip injected into fold of skin

YOUR DOG
Microchipping is a quick and painless procedure to insert a small chip under the skin. It enables your dog to be identified at all times and returned to you if he is lost.

CARE AND TRAINING

Identifying when your dog is ill
Different dogs react to illness in different ways. As an owner,
you know how your dog behaves day to day and are in the best position to recognize any changes away from this norm as soon as they occur. If health problems are recognized and diagnosed early, treatment can start without delay and is more likely to have a successful outcome.
If your dog is in pain, he will probably make this immediately obvious by limping, or yelping when he moves or is handled.
Other physical signs of ill health include breathing difficulties,
such as coughing or heavy panting, for no apparent reason.
Unusual discharges from the eyes or nose are also signs to be noted, as are excessive scratching, hair loss other than normal shedding, an unwillingness to exercise, or a sudden change in eating or drinking habits. However, not all indicators of ill health are physical signs. Changes in temperament or behaviour can also mean that your dog is not well. For example, if your dog becomes unusually aggressive, this may be a protective mechanism because he is uncomfortable or in pain.
It is also wise to keep track of your dog’s toilet habits so that you learn what is normal for him. Any sudden change in amount, appearance, or frequency of production of urine or faeces can indicate a health problem. Similarly, vomiting may be a sign of ill health. Remember, however, that as natural scavengers, dogs have a very active vomit reflex to protect them from anything toxic they may have eaten.

SECURITY BLANKET
A warm blanket can be beneficial in treating many conditions, including shock or hypothermia. It also comforts your dog if you need to leave him at your veterinary surgery. The scent of the blanket will remind him of home and help to reassure him until you return.

Minor injuries and first aid
Your first response when dealing with any injury should be to take your dog to the vet. However, in some situations you may be able to administer first aid before having to move the dog. In the case of severe injury, call for veterinary help and then put your dog in the recovery position. Lay him on his right side and straighten his head and neck to keep the airway free. Pull his tongue forward and to one side of the mouth so that the airway is open. Monitor his breathing and pulse until help arrives.
If there is extensive bleeding from a wound, this must be controlled until a vet can take over. Apply a piece of clean,
absorbent material, such as gauze, to the site of the injury
TOP TIPS

EAR BANDAGE
To protect an ear wound and prevent your dog from scratching it, bandage the ear flap flat against the top of the head. A pair of old tights can make a suitable bandage that goes around the neck and is not too constricting.

■ Check for dehydration
Gently pinch the loose skin on your dog’s back, lift it slightly then let go. In a well-hydrated dog the skin springs back quickly into position. A dehydrated dog’s skin returns more slowly.
■ Check gum colour Pale gums can indicate shock or internal bleeding, and very red gums can be caused by heat stroke or fever. Blue gums suggest a shortage of oxygen in body tissues.

and cover this with bandaging to hold it in place. Take care not to apply too much pressure if you suspect that there is debris in the wound, as you may push it in deeper and cause more damage. Do not attempt to pull any large foreign body, such as broken glass or metal, out of a wound as you could cause severe bleeding.

Home care after surgery
A dog that has had surgery needs plenty of affection and care when he comes home from the vet. He may be very lethargic if he is still recovering from the anaesthetic. On the other hand, he may act as if he is perfectly fine and try to behave as normal, to the detriment of his recovery. Jumping up may pull out stitches or displace broken bones, so encourage your convalescent dog to remain calm by settling him on a blanket in a quiet area of the house, perhaps with a toy to chew, if his vet allows. Make sure children in the household understand that their playmate cannot romp energetically or be allowed to exercise off-lead until he is fully recovered.
After surgery, a dog will almost certainly be given some sort of medication and probably have bandages or stitches.
He may have to wear a special collar, called an Elizabethan collar, to prevent him from touching the wound. If your dog was well handled as a puppy, you are unlikely to have difficulty in giving him any prescribed treatment. There is a good chance that he will just enjoy the extra attention.

CONCEALED TABLET
The easiest way to give your dog a tablet is to hide it in his food.
Watch your dog while he eats, and check the bowl afterwards to make sure the “hidden” tablet has been eaten.
GIVING YOUR DOG MEDICINE
Liquid medicines are best given using a syringe. Gently holding your dog’s mouth shut with one hand, insert the syringe under the side of his lip and slowly squirt the medicine into his mouth.

ELIZABETHAN COLLAR
This protective plastic collar prevents a dog from licking or biting a wound.
Dogs wearing the collar need supervision to ensure they can eat, drink, and move around easily.

Breed-specific problems

Weight issues

Since humans first started breeding dogs, they have been tailoring them for different purposes. As a result,
there is huge diversity among dogs, each breed having its own special qualities and traits. However, in some breeds particular characteristics have been greatly exaggerated,
and you will need to take these into consideration if they apply to your chosen pet, because they can cause health problems. For example, dogs that have been bred to have excess, wrinkly skin are very prone to skin infections and require their wrinkles to be cleaned regularly. Similarly, dogs with very thick coats designed to cope with extremes of cold can develop uncomfortable skin conditions when placed in a relatively temperate climate. Hairless breeds feel the cold,
but are also at risk of sunburn and need to have their skin protected before they go outside. Long-backed dogs may be very good at disappearing down holes after small mammals,
but have problems when faced with going up and down stairs and jumping on to sofas. Dogs bred to have a short, flat face are prone to breathing disorders and also heatstroke, because although they pant, the short muzzle does not give them the means to keep cool effectively.

Dogs are scavengers and tend to eat whatever is placed in front of them, because they do not know when they might next find food. For pet dogs with regular access to plentiful food, this natural trait has led to a high incidence of excess weight gain. Overweight dogs, like overweight humans, are at increased risk of serious health problems. Changes in your dog’s waistline are hard to spot from day to day, so it’s advisable to weigh him regularly as a routine health check.
Owners of very large dogs may need to visit the veterinary surgery to use their scales. If you find your dog is becoming too heavy, aim to reduce his weight gradually by increasing his exercise levels and cutting down his food intake. For a dog that is obese, a vet may recommend a low-fat diet.

There are many health problems associated with excess weight gain in dogs. Recent studies have shown that the stress placed on a dog’s body can shorten his life span by as much as two years.

SKIN PROBLEMS
Deep wrinkles like those of the Shar Pei provide a breeding ground for bacteria and need regular cleaning to prevent infections.

UNDERSHOT JAW
Dogs with undershot jaws, such as the Bulldog, also tend to have short muzzles. In warm environments, air passing through these shorter nasal passages does not have time to cool down properly, and as a result these dogs tend to warm up quickly.
They must pant to cool down and need to do so for longer than other dogs.

H E A LT H

CHECKING YOUR DOG
As your dog gets older, it becomes more important to make regular checks for any new lumps or bumps that may appear.
Signs of pain or discomfort should be reported promptly to your vet.

EXTRA REST
Older dogs need increasing amounts of rest and tend to sleep more deeply. Allow them to lie undisturbed whenever possible and to wake up in their own time.

Elderly dogs
Senior dogs often do very well for many years but, as with humans, old age brings the need for changes. If your ageing dog loses a few teeth and finds it difficult to eat, ensure that he gets the correct level of nutrients for his age by switching to a specific senior diet, usually softer food that is easier to chew. Senior foods also contain nutrients aimed at easing joint pain, which is common in older dogs. Keep brushing your dog’s teeth, because plaque build-up tends to increase in older dogs.
An elderly dog will not require the same amount of exercise as before, but a daily walk improves his circulation and provides much-needed stimulation from sights and smells.
As your dog spends more time lying down, he may be at risk of developing pressure sores, so pay extra attention to vulnerable areas like elbows. If you own a long-coated breed, check that his coat is not becoming matted.
Keep an eye on your dog’s general comfort and make sure that he can still access everything he needs. For example, he may begin to find stairs more challenging, or find it difficult to reach down to a water bowl to drink adequately.
FAILING SIGHT
Many elderly dogs begin to lose their sight, and rely on previous knowledge of their surroundings to get around the house. Think before you start moving furniture and confuse your dog with unexpected new obstacles.

CARE AND TRAINING

Inherited diseases
An inherited disease or disorder is one that is passed from one generation to the next. Such a disease can mean that an individual is born with a medical condition or is genetically predisposed to developing one in later life. In the case of dogs, there are conditions common to each breed that are known to be inherited. These include joint disorders, blindness,
and deafness. Responsible breeders do all they can to make sure that dogs affected by these disorders are neutered to prevent them passing on their genes to the next generation.
Nevertheless, the nature of inheritance means that these conditions can never be eliminated completely, because some dogs are carriers (see box below).
Many inherited disorders can be traced through a pedigree and therefore breeders can take steps to reduce the chances of breeding an affected puppy by choosing their bloodlines

for breeding carefully. Good breeders will be able to go back through several generations to tell you whether any of the dogs in their breeding lines have had medical problems.
They will also know what, if any, conditions remain a potential source of concern in the puppy of your choice.
For many conditions, especially those with a simple recessive inheritance pattern (see box below), screening tests can be carried out. Ask your breeder to show you the results of any tests that are relevant to your puppy or his parents. If one of the parents is a carrier, then their puppies may be too, so it would be unwise to breed from your dog without screening it first. If both parents are carriers, your puppy is at risk of being affected by the condition. Before you visit a breeder, learn all you can about the screening tests that apply to your chosen dog and his likely conditions,
and make sure you know what results to look out for.

GENETICS AND INHERITED DISEASE
A common way for hereditary disorders to be passed on to offspring is through recessive inheritance. In the example of congenital blindness, dogs will be blind if they inherit a recessive gene (r) from both parents. The diagram shows how this can happen.
In cross 1, a sighted dog (RR)
is crossed with a sighted carrier
(Rr). All the offspring possess at least one dominant gene, and as a result are sighted. However, two of the puppies are carriers of the recessive gene for blindness.
In cross 2, both parents are carriers of the recessive gene.
This means that there is a one in four chance that one of the puppies (rr) will inherit the recessive gene from both parents and be born blind;
two puppies will be carriers
(Rr); and one puppy (RR) will have normal sight.

Key

H E A LT H

The likelihood of breeding puppies that develop the joint disorder hip dysplasia can be reduced by checking whether the parents are affected. This is done by assessing an X-ray of their hip joints and giving each a score that is compared to the average for the breed.

CONGENITAL DEAFNESS
Some breeds can inherit deafness, either complete or partial. There is a link between pigmentation and inherited deafness, and breeds with white variation, such as the Dalmatian,
are often more at risk. Deafness should be tested for in all susceptible litters and any affected dogs neutered.

Even an ideal screening result is no guarantee that your puppy will not develop a chronic disorder. If you do have a problem, contact your vet but also be sure to report back to your breeder, who may choose not to repeat the mating that led to your puppy in future.

Think about the future
When you have decided what type of dog you are going to have, it is important to research which hereditary disorders are common problems within that particular breed. Read about each condition and be aware of the implications of taking on a puppy with a problem. Some disorders can be managed relatively easily and do not significantly affect the dog’s general well-being and natural lifespan, although some adaptations may have to be made. A deaf dog, for example, needs to be trained using sign language and will not be able to run safely off-lead the majority of the time. Other disorders are potentially life-threatening and may require dedicated day-to-day, long-term management.
Consider also the increased cost of caring for a dog with a chronic condition. You could be faced with many years of vet’s bills, regular medication, and special diets – and the expenses will soon add up. Work out what you can realistically cope with before going to visit a litter of puppies. It is all too easy to be persuaded to take on a cute puppy, but you may not have the skills, experience, time, or money to care for him adequately.

INHERITED DISORDERS

CAN IT BE
SCREENED FOR?

MANAGING THE

TYPES OF DOG

Intervertebral disc disease

Similar to a prolapsed
(“slipped”) disc in humans;
can cause intense pain and even paralysis.

No. The genetics of the condition are not fully understood.

Can be managed with rest and anti-inflammatory drugs; surgery may be necessary in severe cases.

Achondroplastic (dwarf)
breeds that originated from a genetic mutation for short limbs.

Hip dysplasia

A condition in which the hip joint develops incorrectly.

Yes. An X-ray can be analysed and then measured against the breed average.

Careful management and pain relief is normally sufficient; surgery is available but relatively uncommon.

Heavy-bodied breeds, such as the mastiffs.

Elbow dysplasia

Abnormal development of the elbow joint.

Yes. X-rays of each elbow are analysed and given a numeric score. The overall grade is the higher of the two figures.

Affected dogs often benefit from exercise management and pain relief.

Large breeds. More prevalent in males than females. Rapid growth and weight gain exacerbate the symptoms.

Luxating patella

A congenital condition in which the patella (kneecap)
slips out of its groove.

No. Affected dogs should not be used for breeding.

Controlled exercise and diet are the main treatments, with pain relief if necessary; surgery is indicated only in younger dogs or those with extreme mobility difficulties.

Most prevalent in toy breeds.

The most common inherited bleeding disorder in dogs. Varies in severity but can be lethal.

Yes. By blood and
DNA tests.

Lifestyle adjustments and the use of blood-clotting drugs.

Not breed or group specific.

Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA)

Deterioration of the retina,
leading to blindness.

or unaffected.

Lifestyle management.

Occurs in most breeds but inheritance of the condition differs. Genes may be dominant or recessive.
Symptoms usually apparent by three years of age.

Cataracts

Clouding of the lens of the eye, causing impaired vision.

Yes. For some breeds there is a DNA test. Affected dogs should not be used for breeding.

Cataracts are removed surgically; the operation is relatively simple.

Not breed or group specific and may occur at any age.

Entropion

Inward turning of the eyelids, causing damage to the surface of the eyeball.

No. Affected dogs should not be used for breeding.

CAN IT BE
SCREENED FOR?

MANAGING THE

TYPES OF DOG

Distichiasis

Abnormal growth of the eyelashes. May cause pain and discomfort.

No. Affected dogs should not be used for breeding.

A vet may remove the abnormal hairs by plucking.

May occur in any breed but is more common in those with moderate to heavy skin folds on the head.

Deafness

Complete or partial loss of hearing; can occur from birth or over the course of the dog’s life.

Yes. A non-invasive, painless test can be carried out by a specialist vet.

A dog completely deaf from birth is not recommended for a pet. Partially deaf dogs often have normal lives.

Most common in dogs with white, spotted, dappled, or merle coats. Some dogs also have blue eyes.

Abnormal dentition

In most breeds, the teeth normally meet in a scissor bite. Deviation from this can result in an overshot or undershot jaw.

No. Affected dogs should not be used for breeding.

Most dogs experience no problems. Occasionally,
surgical intervention is called for if the dog has trouble eating or drinking.

An undershot jaw is acceptable in some brachycephalic breeds.
In others, it is considered a fault.

Elongated palate

A condition in which the soft palate at the back of the mouth abnormally overlaps the airway,
obstructing breathing.

No. Affected dogs should not be used for breeding.

Serious cases can be corrected with surgery to remove excess tissue on the palate.

Most prevalent in brachycephalic breeds.

Hypothyroidism

A deficiency in thyroid hormone that causes slow metabolism.

Yes. A blood test is available. Affected dogs should not be used for breeding.

Typical symptoms such as weight gain, lethargy, and hair loss can be controlled with medication.

Occurs in mediumand large-sized dogs.
Symptoms tend to appear when dogs reach middle age.

Diabetes mellitus

A condition in which the dog’s ability to metabolize blood sugar is impaired.

Not breed or group specific.
More common in females.
Symptoms tend to appear when dogs reach middle age.

Cleft palate

The roof of the mouth does not join correctly in the middle, preventing puppies from suckling properly.

No. Any dog that has produced puppies with cleft palates should not be used for further breeding.

Most vets recommend euthanizing affected puppies. Occasionally, it may be possible to hand rear a puppy until it is old enough to undergo corrective surgery.

May occur in any breed or cross-bred dog but most common in brachycephalic breeds.

Megaoesophagus

An enlarged oesophagus that lacks muscle tone and cannot convey swallowed food down to the stomach.
An affected dog constantly regurgitates.

No. Any dog that has produced puppies with megaoesophagus should not be used for further breeding.

Depending on the severity of the condition, changes such as feeding small amounts from a raised bowl can have a positive impact.

Not breed or group specific.
If condition is congenital,
symptoms appear in the first few weeks or months of life.

Epilepsy

A neurological disorder causing characteristic fits or seizures.

Yes. DNA test. Affected dogs should not be used for breeding.

Epilepsy is not curable,
but drug therapy can greatly reduce the likelihood of seizures.

Not breed or group specific.
If congenital, symptoms appear between six months and five years of age.

Hackney gait – Dogs with this type of action, such as the Miniature Pinscher,
raise the lower part of the leg particularly high as they walk.
Harlequin – A colour pattern comprising irregular-sized patches of black on white;
seen only in the Great Dane.

Withers – The highest point of the shoulder,
where the neck meets the back. A dog’s height is measured vertically from the ground to the withers.

The dog breeds listed in this index may be followed by any combination of the initials KC (Kennel Club),
FCI (Federation Cynologique Internationale – the World Canine Organisation), and AKC (American
Kennel Club). The initials indicate which of these three international organizations recognize the breed.
Occasionally the KC, FCI, and AKC recognize the same breed but use a different name to the one used in this book. This alternative name is also listed along with the initials of the organization that uses it. Some breeds have been granted provisional acceptance by the FCI and these are indicated here as FCI*.
Other breeds have no initials following their name but may be recognized by other kennel clubs in their country of origin, and be in the approval process of one of the organizations listed here.
