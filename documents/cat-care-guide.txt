Fit for a Feline
Make your home welcoming
for a cat (or two!). Here are
a few of the basics to help
create a space fit for a feline.
Fresh water and food

Cats need fresh water every day and food
up to three times a day. Feed both dry
and canned food, and follow the label for
portion sizes. If you have multiple cats,
you will need multiple dishes in separate
locations so each cat can eat and drink
undisturbed (same for litter boxes, too!).

A scratching post

A must for any cat’s living space! Cats
use scratching posts to help shed
the outer covering on their claws,
to scent mark (from special glands
in their paws) and to stretch. Cats
like to stretch after waking up or
when entering a room, so place
the post close to an entrance way
or near where your cat sleeps.

Hiding places

4

Sometimes cats just need to get away from it
all. Give your cat plenty of places to hide, like
cardboard boxes, cupboards and paper bags. Make a
tent out of blankets and you’re sure to get a visit!

A look-out

Cats like to get up high and perch.
Why? It makes them feel safe to be
able to view their surroundings from
above. Shelves, window ledges and
tall scratching posts with resting
platforms all make great perching
places. At least one should be big
enough to let your cat stretch out fully.

Kitty Cautions

Cats need a safe environment,
so watch out for these
potential dangers!

Food fears

Automated feeders may
seem convenient, but they
can jam, resulting in hungry
kitties. Instead, a real person
should always fill the food dish. Just
like human food, canned cat food can
spoil, so make sure it doesn’t sit out
too long. As for beverages, stick to
fresh water. Some cats love to lap up
milk, but they can’t digest it properly.

Window worries

Cats love to perch on window
ledges, but if you want your
cat to stay in, be sure the
window isn’t left open! If
your windows have blinds,
keep the cords out of reach. Cats
may like to bat at them, but can easily
become caught and strangled.

Hiding hazards

Cats feel safe when
they have places to
hide, but they need
to be able to escape,
too. Keep tabs on your
cat so she doesn’t
end up trapped in a
drawer or cupboard. And, while paper
bags can be fun places to hide, keep
plastic grocery bags away from Fluffy –
she could get tangled in the bag.

Toy troubles

Not all cat toys are created equal. Avoid
toys with string or small pieces
your cat could swallow. Check
toys frequently and replace wornout ones. Some toys contain cat
nip, which can make some cats
aggressive or hyperactive.
Just like kids, cats need toys. Choose a variety
of toys that help cats mimic natural hunting
behaviours such as chasing, batting,
pouncing and biting – like a ball-in-circle
toy, feather wand, Cat Dancer® or fake
mouse. You can even help your cat
“hunt” for food by hiding kibble around
the house or making a puzzle feeder
(go to spca.bc.ca/crafts for instructions)!

Plant problems

House plants often look
tasty to cats, but they
can be poisonous. Check
the Animal Poison Control
website (aspca.org/apcc)
before bringing a plant into your home.
While munching on cat grass isn’t
poisonous, eating too much can upset
tummies and should be monitored.

get vaccinations, flea control medicine, a
spay or neuter (so we don’t get even more
kittens) and lots more care (see below).

Thousands of abandoned cats and kittens are brought to
the SPCA every year. At the SPCA, cats wait in the shelter
until they are adopted. Many wait months. In places where
there are more cats than homes, the SPCA moves cats to
larger cities so they get adopted sooner.

Adopting is easy. Bring your parents to any
of the SPCA’s 36 shelters. Staff and volunteers
will help pick out the cat of your dreams. There is an
adoption fee between $75 and $179. That may seem like a
lot but the SPCA provides cats with all the care items you
would need to spend on a “free” cat.

Very young kittens are placed in foster homes. For kittens
without moms, caregivers bottle feed kittens every few
hours until they are ready to be adopted. All SPCA cats

Caring for cats as they age

Compared to most other pets, cats
live a long time – about 15 years
on average. Some live into their
twenties. That’s more than 100
years old in human years!

Switch to high quality adult food at six to eight months of age.
Adult cats should be fed at least twice a day. Leaving
food out all the time can lead to overweight cats.
Seniors – cats aged 11 and up – should be
given three to four small meals daily.

Sleep. Cats sleep about 16 hours a day.
Kittens and seniors sleep more than adult cats. Cats at any age, though,
need to be able to rest undisturbed.
Play. Kittens love to play. Use toys, not hands and feet, to play with them.
Otherwise, they might learn to play bite. Ouch!
Cats spend less time playing as they age. Use food to encourage adult cats
to play. Give them puzzle feeders and toss kibble down the hall for them to
chase. Hide kibble around the house for them to find. Playing keeps older
cats active and fit.
Socialize. Introduce kittens to new people, pets and experiences like
nail trims, teeth brushing, grooming, car trips and visits to the
veterinarian. Reward them with praise and treats so they
grow up friendly and curious rather than
shy and afraid. Cats at any age can
be taught tricks such as sit
and come, just like
dogs. Teach new
tricks as they get
older to keep them
active.

Safety first! Curious kittens can
easily get into dangerous situations.
Keep kittens from chewing on
electrical cords, jumping onto hot
stovetops, falling into toilets and
climbing into warm dryers.
Senior cats are also vulnerable.
Make sure food and water dishes
and beds are lower to the floor.
Check that litter boxes are not too
tall for older cats with stiff joints.
Senior cats might also need mats
to keep them from slipping as they
walk, as well as steps or ramps to
help them reach favourite resting
spots.

Bark!

Eat. Kittens should be fed high quality
kitten food three to four times a day.
Introduce them to foods with different
flavours and textures so they get used to variety.

Whether young or old, all cats
eat, sleep, play and socialize –
just in different ways. Below are
some tips to help you care for your
cat through the years.

How can you tell if the cat you are petting is content or about to scratch you?
How do you know when the cat in your arms wants to be let down? Observing a
cat’s body language and studying her face provide clues on how she is feeling.

Meet and greet: Friendly, relaxed dogs sway
their tails from side-to-side. Cats do the opposite. A
friendly, outgoing cat carries her tail stiff and high,
often with the tip pointing toward the person or other
cat she’s greeting.

(it doesn’t take much with some cats) is the swishing or flicking
tail. This often occurs when a cat is being held against his will.
If you don’t put him down he will struggle, twist and scratch
you in an attempt to escape your grasp. You may also see a
resting cat start to “tail-swish” when another cat approaches.
The relaxed cat is signaling he wants to be left alone.

she will puff her fur and
arch her back. Think

she will hiss and growl,
show her teeth and
extend her claws. Her
tail will be puffed up
and stick straight up.
The cat is looking as big
as possible, warning
you to back away or she

You can tell when people are happy by the smiles on their faces. Cats also
communicate their feelings with facial expressions. The position of their
whiskers, ears and even the size of their pupils (the black centre part of the
eye) are used to express their mood. A larger pupil generally means the cat
is stressed or scared. See if you can match the face to the cat’s mood.

purr for several reasons.
Most cats purr when they are
happy and content. Some
purr when eating – especially
nursing kittens. Cats also purr
when they are sick or injured.
Scientists think they do this
because the vibration actually
helps to stimulate healing and
makes cats feel better.

A. Anxious: Uneasy, anxious cats flatten their ears. Their eyes
are “wide-eyed” with enlarged black pupils. Whiskers are pulled flat
against their faces.

Inside or outside – what to
do with you?
Should my cat live inside only or be
allowed outside too? Across Canada,
the majority of cats live indoors all
the time with their caregivers.
There is a lot to consider before you
allow your cat to go outdoors. Safety
for one. Outdoor cats are more likely to
get hurt or sick. Outside they are exposed
to fleas, ticks, mites and internal parasites
such as roundworms and hookworms! Not to
mention getting diseases or injuries from
other cats and wildlife.

It gets worse. Outdoor cats are at risk from

predators – raccoons, dogs, coyotes and

Bark!

Indoor-only cats have
issues too. Some cats
don’t get enough exercise
or become bored or frustrated. Indoor cats need to run,
play and explore. To keep them active you must commit
to playing with your cats daily. Also, provide toys and
places for cats to climb, perch and investigate.
If a cat grew up going outside she may well scratch and
meow to be let outside. To solve this, many caregivers
create a secure screened outdoor area. Outdoor
enclosures keep your cats safe. They also help prevent
your cats from preying on songbirds and other wild
animals such as tree frogs, rabbits, salamanders and
butterflies. Even a small screened porch can satisfy cats
who crave the outdoors. Making an outdoor cat enclosure
can be a great family project.

Harsh weather is also hard on cats. On cold, rainy
days, wet cats can’t trap insulating air in their
fur. If the temperature dips below zero, cats can
quickly get frostbite in their ears, toes and tails.

causing them to run into
traffic or become lost.

My family is bringing our
new cat home. Will she
know to use the litter box?
Unlike dogs, cats don’t need much
housetraining. Even as kittens,
instinct tells them to use a litter
box! Just keep your cat in one room
with her litter box (and places to
sleep, eat and drink) to help her
settle in. Then, after a few days, let
her have the run of the house. She
should return to the litter box when
she has to go to the bathroom.
There are so many
litter boxes to choose
from! Which type is
best?
Most cats prefer
open litter boxes.
Pick a litter box
longer than your
cat and wide
enough for her
to turn around
easily. Boxes with
lids not only trap
in the smell, they
can make cats feel
trapped too.

Wood, recycled paper,
wheat, corn, clay, orange
peels, peanut shells…
which type of litter will my
cat prefer?
Some cats are pickier about
litter than others. In general,
though, cats prefer litters with
no scent and small grains rather
than large pellets.

My, what big teeth
you have!

Your cat’s teeth should be white
and shiny. Her gums should be
bright pink and moist to the touch.
Bad breath, bleeding gums and
brownish teeth could all be signs of
painful gum disease.
Take your cat to the vet at least once
a year to have her mouth checked
as part of an overall health exam.
Your vet may recommend she have
her teeth cleaned under general
anaesthetic (while asleep). Your
vet may also suggest feeding her a
special teeth-cleaning diet.

I spy with my little eye

Normally, cats have bright, clear eyes. Watch for
redness, swelling or goopy discharge. Your cat could
have an eye infection. Eye infections require treatment
with medication from the vet.

Great groomers

Your cat’s fur should be smooth,
thick and shiny. Cats keep their
coats in such great condition by
grooming themselves every day
with their bristly tongues. Lack of
grooming is a sign your cat might
not be feeling well. She may need to
see the vet.

Bark!

Got shots?

12

Brushing up

Brush your cat to help her remove
loose hair. The less hair she ingests
while licking herself, the fewer
hairballs (balls of hair that collect
in her stomach) she might throw up.
Short-haired cats can be brushed a
few times a week. Brush long-haired
cats daily to help prevent mats.

Vaccines help protect cats against diseases that can make them very sick. Outdoor
cats are more at risk of catching these diseases. Cats are usually vaccinated
three times as kittens, then once every one to three years as adults. Your vet can
recommend what vaccines your cat needs.

Do you hear what I hear?

Your cat’s ears should be pale pink, clean and odourless. Beware ears that
are red and swollen, smelly or filled with dark, waxy buildup! Take your cat
to the vet to have them checked for infection.
Itchy ears could mean your cat has ear mites. Ear mites are tiny, eightlegged parasites that feed on the wax and oils in a cat’s ear canal. Visit
your vet for medication to treat the mite problem.

Flea free

Kittens can have kittens!

Have your cat spayed or neutered before six months of age. Spaying and
neutering are surgical operations performed by a vet to prevent animals
from reproducing (having babies). That way, you can help prevent
unwanted litters.

*

Bonus! Cats who are spayed or neutered are usually calmer, more
content to stay home and less likely to get certain cancers.
Paw spa

To help keep your furniture – and
you! – from getting scratched, have
your cat’s nails trimmed by an adult
or your vet. Cutting them too short
can be painful and cause them to
bleed. Never have cats declawed.

Is your cat scratching and chewing
at her fur? She could have fleas!
Fleas are small, wingless insects
that feed on blood. The best flea
control medications are available at
your vet clinic.

Hookworms,
roundworms and
tapeworms, oh my!

Cats can carry worms that live, feed
and reproduce inside them. Yikes!
Common types include hookworms,
roundworms and tapeworms.
Worms can cause a variety of
symptoms such as vomiting,
diarrhea and weight loss. Luckily,
medication for worms is easy to get
from your vet.

Accidents happen?

Cats normally have excellent litter box habits. Should your cat urinate
outside the litter box, take her to the vet for a health exam right away.
Serious medical problems such as diabetes, kidney stones and bladder
infections can all cause cats to have accidents in the house.

The 5 Freedoms
for Felines
Cats are often said to have nine lives. But we know, in reality, cats have
only one life – and our job as guardians is to make sure they enjoy it!
We can give our cats the best life possible by providing them with the
Five Freedoms. The Five Freedoms are a set of animal welfare guidelines
used around the world. Each freedom describes a different part of the
care required to meet an animal’s needs. Taken together, the
Five Freedoms show us how to be great cat guardians.

1 Freedom from
hunger and thirst by
giving cats the correct
food and fresh water.
2 Freedom from pain,
injury and disease by
providing cats with
regular veterinary care
and a safe environment.
3 Freedom from distress
by making sure cats are
never neglected or abused,
and do not feel scared,
anxious, frustrated or
depressed.
4 Freedom from discomfort by
providing cats with a comfortable
home that is warm, dry, clean and
quiet.

Remember, as guardians, we are responsible for our
cats’ health and well-being. And guess what? With all
you have learned in this cat care guide, you are ready to
begin providing the Five Freedoms to your cats today!
