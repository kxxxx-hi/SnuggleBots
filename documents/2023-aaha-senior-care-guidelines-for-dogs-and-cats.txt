ABSTRACT
Veterinary professionals are taught to recognize that ‚Äúold age is not a disease.‚Äù However, clients may have the perception that
older dogs and cats undergo an unavoidable physical, mental, and behavioral decline attributable simply to old age. The veterinary team‚Äôs role includes providing medical care and support to senior pets to maintain their quality of life, as well as supporting
and educating clients on proper senior animal care and addressing any misconceptions about the aging process. These Guidelines describe a systematic approach to the healthcare of the senior pet that is based on an evidence-guided assessment of
both healthy and unhealthy canine and feline patients. By using evidence-guided medicine, which may include conventional
and integrative approaches as well as environmental management for the senior pet, the patient‚Äôs quality of life can be
enhanced and potentially extended during this vulnerable life stage. Developing a senior program for the veterinary practice
requires appropriate training of the entire healthcare team and includes a robust client education program that focuses on the
wellbeing of the senior pet. Palliative and hospice care should be included in the education and information provided for both
the veterinary team and the families of senior pets. (J Am Anim Hosp Assoc 2023; 59:1‚Äì21. DOI 10.5326/JAAHA-MS-7343)

Aging may have multiple biochemical changes that are noticeable only in the later stages of the age-related change. Earlier identiÔ¨Åcation of age-related changes may improve the quality and quantity
of life, but additional research is needed to detect those early biochemical changes and be able to use them as screening tests. Immunosenescence is the process of immune dysfunction that occurs with
age. Immunosenescence involves the remodeling of lymphoid organs,
leading to changes in the immune function of the elderly, which is
closely related to the development of infections, autoimmune diseases, and malignant tumors.6 Evidence for this phenomenon has
been reported in human medicine, but there is limited evidence in
veterinary medicine. InÔ¨Çammaging is another concept reported in
human medicine, which posits that the rate of aging and age-related

Anesthetic and Surgical Considerations
Practitioners will Ô¨Ånd the 2020 AAHA Anesthesia and Monitoring
Guidelines for Dogs and Cats to be a useful, comprehensive supplement to this section of the Senior Care Guidelines.16
Senior pets may require general anesthesia for surgical and nonsurgical procedures, such as dental care, to treat ailments and/or
improve their QOL. Advanced age alone is not a contraindication to
general anesthesia. Senior pets can safely undergo multiple anesthetic
events if necessary. Medication choices and other precautions should
be considered to minimize the risk for the pet. Because clients may
have additional anxiety about anesthesia for their senior pet, the role
of the veterinarian and technician includes reassuring the client of
the indication for and safety of the procedure.
An anesthetic evaluation should include a preoperative physical
examination, focusing on diseases that may increase risk. In addition
to the physical examination, preoperative laboratory tests should be
performed, with a speciÔ¨Åc focus on renal (creatinine) and cardiac
function (N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide). Imaging,
including radiographs and ultrasonography, may also be indicated.

From a surgical standpoint, the beneÔ¨Åt to quality or quantity of
life should be established with the client before surgery is performed.
Many surgeries, including dental procedures, can result in substantial
improvement in QOL. However, perhaps the biggest predictor of
postsurgical QOL is preprocedure function; for example, a healthy,
robust 15 yr old terrier would be expected to recover quickly from a
mass removal, whereas a 13 yr old Labrador mixed-breed dog with
geriatric onset laryngeal paralysis polyneuropathy (GOLPP), severe
osteoarthritis, and International Renal Interest Society (IRIS) stage 3
renal disease may require a longer recovery time.68
The surgeon should be experienced with the procedure and/or
have adequate training in similar techniques. All necessary equipment should be prepared and potential surgical needs anticipated
(e.g., implant, speciÔ¨Åc instrument). For senior pets, recovery times
are improved with speed of the procedure and meticulous focus by
the surgeon. Perioperative antibiotics and pain management should
be provided if indicated. Postprocedural return to function is
enhanced with appropriate analgesics, and physical therapy/rehabilitation may also lead to a more rapid return to function.

Preoperative care may include preprocedural IV Ô¨Çuids in a patient
with compromised renal function, where fasting or anxiety associated

Unknown Diagnosis or Comorbidities
Senior pets may have several concurrent medical issues and associated clinical signs. These complex cases may be referred to an appropriate specialist. Alternatively, the client may opt for palliative care,
and it may be helpful to have a trained palliative care veterinarian to
consult with on the case.
There may be clients who do not wish to pursue diagnostics for
a number of reasons, including the age of the pet, concern and fear
of certain test procedures or outcomes, and Ô¨Ånancial constraints. If
the client chooses to not pursue diagnostics or treatment, veterinarians should discuss the beneÔ¨Åt of symptomatic treatment and how it
can improve the pet‚Äôs QOL. This may encourage the client to access
and continue palliative care. If the client chooses to seek additional
diagnostics, then either performing them or seeking referral to a specialist may be indicated for complex comorbidities.

Cognitive dysfunction may be a diagnosis of exclusion. A thorough history, physical examination, neurological examination,
biochemical evaluation, and urinalysis are integral to ensure these
animals do not have other underlying disease causing similar clinical
signs. Neurological examination may be consistent with forebrain

of the brain is recommended to rule out structural disease. Other
differentials for similar behavior changes may include intracranial

care and may proceed to a discussion of palliative care, hospice, or

The Veterinary Team in End-of-Life Care
The veterinary team can guide clients to decisions by advocating for
both the senior pet and client. The veterinary team includes the veterinarian, credentialed technicians, veterinary assistants, and client service
representatives. Additional team members that may help with end-oflife care can include mental health professionals and grief counselors,
pharmacies, compounding pharmacies, groomers, pet sitters, respite
workers, spiritual leaders, and end-of-life care specialists. Although the
client is generally the best advocate for the pet, veterinary teams may
help guide them toward the best decision for both the pet and family.

Planning for the Senior Pet‚Äôs Appointment
Providing a senior pet owner a questionnaire to Ô¨Åll out before a visit
can help clients focus on behavior and note changes they may be seeing with their senior pet. When a family schedules an appointment,
provide a species-speciÔ¨Åc senior pet questionnaire. Instructions on
taking video of pets can be included, and clients can be asked to take
pictures and videos displaying mobility and any abnormal behavior

 Changes that can help with mobility: toe grips and boots, harnesses
for mobility, relocating a dog‚Äôs play or resting area closer to the

A Senior Care Kit will help clients support their senior pet and
improve QOL. Other useful tools could include encouraging clients
to take pictures and videos of their pets within a speciÔ¨Åed time (i.e.,
daily, weekly, or monthly) to help the client and the veterinarian
track body condition changes, mobility, joyful activities, and other
behaviors associated with the senior life stage. Having clients see
these changes over time will help them better assess QOL as the pet‚Äôs
disease progresses.
It is helpful to provide families of older pets with a checklist of
what to look for (and what to avoid) regarding appropriate pet sitters,

Ô¨Çooring, and assistance with getting the pet in and out of the car are
all valued services the practice can add to the senior care experience.
Videos of the changes the hospital has made to become senior
friendly may also be a good addition to the website. An end-of-life
care section can be developed that may include a QOL assessment,
pain management with validated tools, information about caregiver
burden, and pet loss and grief resources. Clinic websites often focus
on puppy and kitten pictures‚Äîa practice can stand out as senior
friendly by ensuring that senior pets make up at least 30% of the
visual content of the hospital‚Äôs website.
Managing the Caregiver Burden
Caring for a senior pet takes time, patience, money, and emotional
and often physical stamina. It can take an emotional and physical
toll on the caregivers and lead to caregiver burden. Practices can support clients by developing an education program on caregiver burden. The hospital may alleviate some of the load by helping the client
in several ways‚Äîfor example, providing a Senior Care Kit with lists
of people who may be able to provide pet sitting or respite care,
offering options for medications that are easier to administer (e.g.,
using compounding pharmacies to create palatable medications),
providing a veterinary technician or assistant to help with the daily

limits of telemedicine and provide informed consent for pet owners.
Challenges may arise with the quality of images, the accuracy of the
description of the concern, missed symptoms or physical cues, and
diagnosis without diagnostic testing. Breaches of privacy, ransomware, or malfunctions are additional concerns.79 Clarity on the scope
of care should be addressed with the caregiver during the visit, along
with advice to follow up in person as needed.
Teleconsultation with specialists can aid patient care when specialty practices are hard to access. Check with your practice act
regarding advice obtained from a veterinarian from out of state.
Reports and information also may be transmitted by photo, audio,

mote senior pet care and client education to explain the practice‚Äôs

The caregiver-pet bond is unique to all animals, and veterinary
teams should recognize that this bond means different things to different people. Practitioners should work with clients to make sure the
animal is not suffering, as sometimes families have difÔ¨Åculty letting go
of a pet at the end of life. Teams should be educated on how to recognize and anticipate bereavement and grief. Support should be provided
for team members who work in emotionally charged situations and
may feel overtaxed or take on the pain clients are feeling. Veterinary
team members should be encouraged to seek help when needed.80

Summary
All companion animal practices should ascribe special status to the
senior patient because these clients usually have a very strong, longterm relationship with their pets. Many families of senior pets place
an intrinsic value on their animals as personal companions and family members. Senior pet care presents an opportunity for a practice
to implement optimum and individualized healthcare for its geriatric
patient population.
The onset of the senior life stage differs somewhat for dogs and
cats and within breeds for both species. A thorough diagnostic
assessment as described in the Guidelines will help the practitioner
determine the speciÔ¨Åc needs of the senior pet. The senior pet‚Äôs
healthcare plan can then be differentiated into evidence-guided protocols for the healthy and unhealthy patient. Using this approach,
senior pet care becomes a carefully staged healthcare plan designed
to preserve and extend the patient‚Äôs QOL and maintain a strong,
active relationship between the pet and family. Practices that adopt a
proactive senior pet health care philosophy can educate clients that
the aging process is not an inevitable physical, mental, and behavioral decline that warrants minimal medical intervention.

healthcare recommendations for the senior pet. When both the practice team and the practice‚Äôs clients understand the goals for senior
pet care, successfully implementing an effective healthcare program
for older pets is all but ensured.
