Making sure your pet has good nutrition is a crucial but often overlooked part of being a responsible pet owner. Cats need a diet rich in high-quality fats and proteins, along with specific amino acids, like taurine, that aren’t found in dog food or human food. Cats should be fed commercially formulated, nutritionally balanced food rather than homemade diets, which are often deficient in key essential vitamins and minerals.

What Are The Nutritional Standards for Cats?

The Feline Nutrition Expert Subcommittee of the

Association of American Feed Control Officials

(AAFCO) has set basic nutritional requirements for cats.

National Research Council

(NRC) has created nutrient profiles for both cats and kittens.

World Small Animal Veterinary Association

(WSAVA) offers guidelines for nutrition of cats and other small animals worldwide.

In the United States, pet food must include a “nutritional adequacy statement.” This statement shows that the food provides complete and balanced nutrition for a specific life stage, such as growth, reproduction, or adult maintenance. If the food doesn’t meet these standards, it must be labeled only as a treat or for occasional feeding.

What Should I Feed My Cat?

Cats are carnivores, meaning they eat mainly meat. But they should not just be fed the kind of meat humans eat. There are many commercial cat foods designed to provide complete and balanced nutrition for cats at different life stages, including kittens, adults, and seniors. However, not all cat foods are of the same quality.

Well-known brands usually have scientific research and quality control behind them. Your veterinarian can recommend a diet that is suitable for your cat.

Some specialty diets are created for cats with specific health problems, such as obesity (being overweight) or kidney disease. Many of these diets require a prescription and can be obtained only through a veterinarian.

Here are some important points to remember about what you feed your cat:

Don’t give supplements without your vet's approval.

Avoid giving table scraps.

Never feed your cat dog food as a regular diet. Cats and dogs have very different nutritional needs.

Milk is not a recommended treat for cats and can actually upset a cat's stomach.

Raw meat is not safe for cats and can pose health risks. Raw meat and dairy products of any kind, including raw milk, should not be fed to cats.

Cats are carnivores, meaning they eat mainly meat. However, it’s important to know that a limited amount of carbohydrates isn’t necessarily bad for them. Depending on their life stage and the type of carbohydrate, cats can digest a small amount effectively, and some carbohydrates are needed in their diets. Keep in mind that foods labeled “grain-free” aren’t always low in carbohydrates.

If you’re considering feeding your cat a homemade diet, you should not formulate the diet on your own. Instead, you should talk to your veterinarian and, ideally, to a veterinary nutritionist about what to feed your cat so that you provide your pet with complete and balanced nutrition. Follow your veterinarian’s advice for how to feed it to your cat.

How Should I Feed My Kitten?

Kittens need extra calories, fats, proteins, vitamins, and minerals to support their rapid growth. They should be fed multiple times a day (3–4 times a day when they're less than 4 months old) with specially formulated kitten food. As they grow, the number of feedings can be decreased, but they should continue eating kitten food until they reach adulthood, at about 9–12 months old.

How Often Should I Feed My Cat?

Cats generally prefer small, frequent meals. However, leaving food out all the time (known as "free-choice feeding") is not recommended, because it can lead to overeating. Overfeeding can lead to obesity and other serious health problems, which can shorten your cat's life. Most cats can be fed twice a day to be happy and kept at a good weight.

Automatic feeders can help manage your cat’s daily food intake and prevent overfeeding or underfeeding. Your veterinarian can help you determine the right amount of food to keep your cat at a healthy weight.

A cat that isn’t eating enough might be sick. If your cat refuses to eat for more than a day, you should take it to the vet right away.

Where Should I Put My Cat's Food?

Cats like to eat alone, so meals should be served in a quiet area away from distractions. If you have multiple pets, it’s a good idea to set up separate feeding stations to decrease stress and competition for food. You can also use puzzle feeders (which release small amounts of food, a little at a time, as your cat manipulates the puzzle) to engage your cat’s natural hunting instincts.

Does My Cat Need a Water Bowl?

Always provide multiple bowls of fresh, clean water for your cat, and be sure to clean them daily.

Feeding wet food, like canned cat food, can also help your cat get enough water. This is one reason many veterinarians recommend wet food over dry food.

You might also consider using a water fountain to encourage your cat to drink more, because cats are often attracted to, and like to play with, moving streams of water.

If your cat seems to drink a lot and pee a lot, there might be a problem. Talk to your veterinarian.
