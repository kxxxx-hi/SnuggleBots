Vaccine Myths in Dogs and Cats: What the WSAVA Says

» Vaccine Myths In Dogs And Cats What The Wsava Says

Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to protect dogs and cats from life-threatening diseases. Even so, misinformation has led some pet owners to question vaccines’ safety, necessity, and frequency. The World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) Vaccination Guidelines 2024 provide clear, science-based recommendations to address these concerns and ensure pets receive the protection they need. Let’s discuss these guidelines.

Myth #1: Vaccines are unsafe and cause severe side effects

Some fear that vaccines can harm pets or cause chronic diseases. The WSAVA states that modern vaccines undergo rigorous testing to ensure safety and effectiveness. While mild reactions like temporary soreness or fever can occur, serious adverse effects are

. The risk of disease far outweighs the minimal risk of vaccination.

Another common concern is that pets are vaccinated too frequently (over-vaccinated), leading to health issues. The WSAVA guidelines emphasize strategic vaccination based on individual risk

rather than automatic annual boosters. Many core vaccines provide long-lasting immunity, reducing the need for frequent revaccination.

Myth #2: Indoor pets don’t need vaccines

Some owners believe that if their pet stays indoors, vaccinations aren’t necessary. However, infectious diseases can still reach indoor pets through humans, contaminated objects, or exposure to other animals. For example:

Canine distemper and parvovirus can survive on surfaces for extended periods.

Feline herpesvirus and calicivirus can be transmitted by human clothing or visitors.

Rabies is a legal requirement in many areas, even for indoor pets.

Core vaccines remain essential for all dogs and cats, regardless of their lifestyle.

Myth #3: Titer testing can replace vaccination

A titer test measures the level of antibodies in a pet’s blood to determine immunity against specific diseases. Some owners prefer titer testing instead of routine vaccinations, believing it prevents unnecessary boosters.

Titer testing can be useful in certain circumstances. For dogs, titer testing may be an alternative to revaccination for three core diseases:

Canine distemper virus (CDV)

Canine adenovirus (CAV-2, hepatitis)

Canine parvovirus (CPV-2)

A positive titer test means a dog still has immunity and may not need a booster at that time. The WSAVA supports using titers in these cases to prevent unnecessary vaccination.

While helpful in some situations,

titer testing has

limitations

It only measures circulating antibodies, not full immune protection (such as cell-mediated immunity).

reliable for all vaccines, especially those that don’t produce long-term immunity, such as:

Leptospirosis (a bacterial disease with short-term vaccine protection)

Bordetella (kennel cough)

Rabies (legally required in many regions)

It can be more expensive than vaccination without guaranteeing better protection.

The WSAVA advises pet owners to consult your veterinarian about whether titer testing is appropriate for your pet.

Conclusion: Trust the Science

The WSAVA Vaccination Guidelines make it clear:

vaccination is a critical tool for disease prevention in pets

. While titer testing can help reduce unnecessary boosters in some cases, it does not eliminate the need for vaccination. By following science-based guidelines, pet owners can ensure their dogs and cats stay protected while avoiding misinformation.
