Veterinary Telehealth Guidelines

The Animal & Veterinary Service (AVS) and Singapore Veterinary Association (SVA) support the use of technology to provide remote/virtual veterinary care, while ensuring that animal health and welfare standards are upheld, with responsible practice. A new set of guidelines jointly developed by AVS and SVA provides a resource for veterinarians, pet owners and members of the public on veterinary telehealth. These guidelines serve to set the boundaries, identify areas of risk, and offer guidance on how to practice veterinary telehealth safely in the interest of animal welfare, health, and safety, giving confidence to both veterinarians and clients, if and when they employ veterinary telehealth.
