K IT T EN CA RE GUIDE

HEALTH IS LIFE’S FOUNDATION
Tailored nutrition for their healthy development

Congratulations on your new family member! Bringing home a new kitten is
wonderful, but we know it can be a bit hectic. That’s why we’ve put together
this guide with valuable information on nutrition, training and health care.
We’re so excited for all of the new experiences you and your kitten will have
together. From playtime to nap time, from kitten to senior years, we know
there are many important life stages ahead, each with their own unique
nutritional support requirements. That’s why we created our formulas
based on a cat’s age, breed, lifestyle and special needs.
We include important nutrients like easy-to-digest protein and omega-3
fatty acids to help support your kitten’s growth and development in a
kibble that’s an ideal size, texture and shape for smaller mouths.
Your kitten’s environment is very important and should support your pet’s
need for hunting, hiding, climbing, playing and sleeping. Our kitten formulas
provide the energy levels needed for healthy growth and development.
We know you have many options when choosing the right food for your
kitten. Thank you for your support of Royal Canin and sharing our passion
for healthy and happy pets. Please contact our Customer Care team

Preparing for Your New Kitten
This is an exciting time for you, but it can also be a time of adjustment
for your new kitten. Your new pet will be leaving the security of their
mother and littermates, and will experience a multitude of new sights,
sounds and smells.
To help you with this transition, the team at Royal Canin has gathered
essential information to assist in welcoming your new pet home.

Choosing a Veterinarian
It is important that your new kitten has an initial check-up and regular
follow-up care, so choosing a veterinarian before your new kitten
comes home can save time. Here are a few tips for helping you
choose a vet:
PROXIMIT Y

Choose a veterinarian that’s close to your home for safety, security
and convenience.
τ Ask family and friends
for veterinarian
recommendations
τ Schedule a
veterinary visit
soon after bringing
your kitten home
τ Keep emergency
veterinary clinic
numbers handy

HOURS

Many veterinarians have extended evening or weekend hours. Make
sure your vet’s hours of operation work with your schedule, particularly
during your kitten’s first few months.
EMERGENCIES

Does the veterinarian answer after-hours emergency calls or work
with a local emergency clinic that’s close to you?

τ Trust Royal Canin
to provide nutrition
for your pet’s needs

Making Your Home Safe

Care

Kittens are natural explorers; you will need to make sure the whole
house is safe from anything the kitten could get into. By kitten-proofing
now, you can avoid a lot of heartache later. Getting down to your kitten’s
eye level will enable you to assess potential hazards.

KIT TEN’S FIRST THINGS
1 Hide electrical wires and block unused outlets
2 Limit access to balconies and decks
3 Put away all pesticides, weed and rat killers and all medications
4 Put away small items, such as rubber bands, pens, pencils,

needles, etc.
5 Don’t leave plastic bags or items made of foam lying around
6 Close the trash can lid and the toilet seat cover
7 Be careful with hot irons
8 Remove all indoor plants that are in reach of your new kitten

Many household plants are toxic to cats
9 Look for possible hiding places to minimize the risk of accidents

Kittens have a tendency to lurk in cupboards, drawers, laundry
baskets, and get inside washing machines and dryers
10 Watch where you walk

Take care to make sure your kitten is not in the doorway
when you shut doors

Check under the
“Health Care” section
of this booklet and
with your veterinarian
for a list of poisonous
substances.

Preparing for Your New Kitten
Take Care of These Basic Equipment Needs
Before Your Kitten’s Arrival
F O O D A N D WAT E R B O W L S

S C R AT C H I N G P O S T

Glass, crystal or pottery bowls are
recommended. Choose a small one
for dry kitten food and a bigger bowl
for fresh water, which must always
be available.

Providing appropriate places to
scratch will help prevent damage
inside your home.

LIT TER BOX

A covered litter box can help avoid
spills, but not all kittens like covered
litter boxes. Select a litter box that
you know your kitten will use to
encourage good litter box habits.
BEDDING

The kitten will choose its own place
to sleep, but it is important to provide
a warm, comfortable place where
the kitten will feel safe, perhaps
even the kitten’s carrying crate.

6

R O YA L C A N I N ® K I T T E N C A R E G U I D E

C AT T R E E

Kittens love to climb high, and a
cat tree helps to limit excessive
rushing about and jumping on
furniture while at the same time
allowing the kitten to satisfy the
need for exercise.
TOYS

Toys can be either bought or
handmade, and it’s best to move
gently and avoid shouting when
introducing your kitten to their
new toys and surroundings.
To help prevent your kitten from
being a nervous adult, play gently.

At Home Together
™

Your Kitten’s First Nights
You are now responsible for your kitten’s safety. Similar to it's mother,
your kitten will rely on you for confidence and protection.

Care

1 Your kitten's first night in their new home can be an adjustment.
It may be normal for her to cry the first three or four nights, but be
sure to check on her to ensure she is safe.
2 Remember to handle your kitten carefully and avoid rough
or sudden movements
3 If you want to carry your kitten, the best way is to slide one hand,
open wide, under the stomach, with the other under the rear end
for bigger breeds—do not slide both hands under the front feet

Introducing Children
Children tend to smother the new arrival with attention. While an adult
cat is perfectly capable of avoiding children when they don’t want to be
bothered, a kitten is not.
When you bring the kitten home, supervise young children and remind
them to play gently to help keep both the kitten and children safe.
Explain that the kitten is not a toy, and because the kitten needs lots
of sleep, no one is allowed to wake the kitten just to cuddle or play.

τ An adult should
always be present
when children play
with a kitten

Introducing Your Kitten to Other Family Pets

τ Introduce cats in
a neutral area, over
a period of time

A poor introduction of your new kitten to your existing pets could
cause a feeling of frustration and/or jealousy for your existing pet(s),
so introduce your new kitten gradually and gently.
Isolate the kitten initially, and let them gradually learn the way around
the house so they don’t hide under furniture. Maintain your existing
pet’s privileges for the first few days, but for proper household
integration, make introductions soon after your kitten arrives home.

τ Take precautions
to keep your
new kitten from
being frightened
or anxious

C AT S

An adult cat does not appreciate any invasion of territory and may show
displeasure with threatening behavior, but do not allow any aggression.
Try introducing the cats on neutral territory during play. Repeat the
process until the cats no longer mind each other’s presence. A gradual
hierarchical relationship that you should respect will be established
between the cats, but total acceptance may take several months.
DOGS

A well-socialized dog will easily accept your new kitten. Older dogs may
be less tolerant, but a few introductions will soon make the dog more
comfortable, and integration will generally take place quickly without
major problems.
7

Kitten Hygiene
Clipping Your
Kitten’s Claws
Kittens most often use their
claws to mark territory. To avoid
the damage that this can cause,
without prohibiting natural
instincts, it is recommended that
you cut or have your vet cut the
tips of the nails. Before doing this
yourself, ask your vet to explain
which part of the nail you can
cut without risk. Do not attempt
to cut nails without a thorough
understanding from your vet on
how to properly do this.
Clipping the nails is not painful
for the kitten; however, your cat
may not enjoy this procedure.
Therefore, it is very important that
you begin this practice at an early
age so the kitten will trust and
allow you to do so.

8

R O YA L C A N I N ® K I T T E N C A R E G U I D E

Nail clippers designed for kittens
are ideal. Clip the white tip of the
claw without ever going close
to the edge of the pink triangle.
Choose a comfortable spot and
you can place the kitten on your
knees, holding your pet’s body
between your thighs. After each
clip, it is a good idea to relax the
kitten by regularly stroking.

Caring for Your
Kitten’s Teeth
Milk teeth appear from the third
to sixth week and the second
teeth come in after four months.
Tartar tends to build up on your
cat's teeth over time, so ask your
veterinarian how to care for your
cat's teeth. When you take your cat
to the vet for routine check-ups,
the veterinarian will be monitoring
your cat's oral health.

Kitten Grooming
™

Brushing and Combing

Care

Kittens will start self-grooming from the fifteenth day of life, mainly
with their particularly rough tongue, but also with their paws. The front
paws are moistened with the tongue and serve as a washcloth, reaching
as far as the ears. The back paws are very flexible, allowing the kitten
to groom all of the back and also the ears.
Start brushing your kitten early to get them accustomed to the brush,
and this ritual will quickly become a time of shared pleasure and
companionship. In addition, a beautiful coat reflects not only good
health, but also the care and attention you give.
• Choose your comb or brush carefully; a comb penetrates the coat
better than a brush
• Always comb or brush your kitten in the natural direction of the
hair first, and then against the hair to gently remove dead hair and
eliminate small knots
• Areas behind the ears and neck are prone to forming knots and
require special attention because the kitten isn’t able to reach those
areas herself
• When a knot is difficult, act gently and patiently rather than pulling
hard and tearing out a tuft
• Finish the grooming with the tail, brushing along its length
(with the hair and against the hair) for maximum volume

S H O R T- H A I R E D B R E E D S

HAIRBALL S

• With short-haired cats, a weekly
brushing is more than sufficient

Brushing is not just a luxury;
it’s a necessity.

• Before brushing, you can
massage against the hair
direction with a “toothed” glove,
which will eliminate dead hair
and stimulate the skin

Removing the dead hair that
accumulates in the fur prevents
your kitten from swallowing
it. Too much licking can cause
hair to build up in the stomach,
resulting in hairballs that can
cause digestive problems like
vomiting, and be harmful to
the kitten’s growth.

• Brushing is done with a soft
brush, preferably one with
natural bristles, so as not
to damage the coat
MID- TO LONG-HAIRED BREEDS
AND PERSIANS

• Mid- to long-haired breeds need
daily brushing for a few minutes
• Regular brushing prevents the
formation of knots and tangles
and eliminates dirt and parasites

Adult cats that have recurring
hairballs may benefit from a
diet formulated to help promote
digestive transit. This helps
move ingested hair through
the digestive tract to allow for
elimination of the hair instead
of regurgitation of the hairballs.

• A large-toothed metal comb
is the most suitable tool for
grooming these breeds
• Areas behind the ears and
neck are the most prone
to knots and tangles

Bathing
The first bath should be a pleasant experience. Take extreme caution not to frighten
your kitten.
• After filling the bottom of the bathtub or sink with water at 96-98° F, place your
kitten in it while calming the kitten with reassuring stroking and gentle talking
• Begin by moistening the kitten with a warm, wet washcloth or sponge
• Always use a special cat shampoo formulated for your kitten’s skin and hair
(available in pet shops or from your veterinarian)
• Wet the back, making sure that you don’t pour water into the eyes or ears
• Wash your kitten’s coat, concentrating on the dirty parts, and rinse thoroughly
with clean water
• Towel dry with a warm, clean cloth; you might want to use a hairdryer on a low
setting to finish drying

Eating Behavior and Feeding Guidelines

Nutrition

There are several common feeding behaviors that cat owners should
be aware of that can be utilized to enhance their cat’s overall health
and well-being:
Smaller, more frequent meals are preferred: Many cats are grazers
and prefer eating multiple small meals per day, with a shortened
duration of each meal.
Environment can impact consumption: Many factors can influence
a cat’s appetite, including breed, habits, activity level and instincts.
Additionally, cats that are indoor exclusively can sometimes overeat
due to a lack of opportunity to hunt, and boredom.
Cats savor more than flavor: Kittens and cats have significantly fewer
taste buds than dogs or humans. While flavor can have an influence
on cats’ preferences, the aroma, texture, kibble size and shape are
as important as the flavor in defining palatability for a cat. Over time,
cats will prefer a food that meets a specific nutrient balance versus
one that has flavors that humans think might be appealing.
MIXED FEEDING

The sophisticated instincts of cats play an obvious role in their behavior
and nutritional needs. Cats can show an increased interest for
different sensorial experiences throughout their lives that can be
satisfied with mixed feeding. Routinely feeding a nutritionally complete
and balanced wet food with the right complementary dry food can also
help support healthy hydration and help achieve an optimal weight.
T R A N S I T I O N F O O D S S L O W LY

Any sudden change in the type of food can trigger digestive upset
(soft stools, diarrhea). Ask the person you obtained the kitten from
about their feeding methods (number of meals per day, rationed or
unmeasured) and types of meals.
A transitional period for changing from one food to another should
be observed over one week by gradually mixing the new food with
the old food until you are feeding the new food exclusively. This
transition helps to minimize the risks of digestive upset, which
can be harmful to your kitten’s proper development.
AV O I D TA B L E S C R A P S

To maintain a balanced diet, avoid feeding table scraps. Your cat
will identify your meals with their own food and will continually
beg to be fed. An unbalanced diet can also lead to obesity or
nutritional deficiencies.

DON’T OVERFEED

Follow the guidelines
recommended on
the bag, as this
will help prevent
problems with
obesity, which could
affect the kitten later
in life. If you think
your kitten is over or
underweight, consult
your veterinarian
for specific feeding
recommendations.

M A K E S U R E F R E S H WAT E R I S A LWAY S AVA I L A B L E

Whatever type of food you give your kitten, make sure your pet
always has a bowl of fresh, clean water. Most importantly, allow
your kitten to eat and drink water without disturbing them.

11

Understanding a Kitten’s Growth
The twelve-month growth period (fifteen months for Maine Coons)
is the most important stage in a kitten’s life. Not only are they learning
future behaviors, but their body gradually takes on its shape and size.
By the time a kitten reaches adult weight, they will have multiplied
their birth weight by 40 to 50 times. Many factors, including breed
and gender, influence growth. And good nutrition plays a major role.

Factors Specific to the Kitten
BREED

Like the majority of living species, the bigger the cat breed,
the longer the growth period.
GENDER

The male is usually larger, with a higher growth potential than the
female, and full growth to adult weight can take several weeks longer.
Male cats will therefore be heavier than female cats.
GENES

The father and mother contribute equally to the kitten’s genetic code.
Size and any morphological feature can influence growth.
HORMONES

Certain hormones synthesized by the kitten influence growth.
Early neutering or spaying does not affect the ultimate size
(height, bone structure, musculature) of the adult cat; this is
determined by genetics. However, neutering or spaying does
affect weight gain and fat deposition.

SPECIAL NEEDS OF THE VERY
YOUNG KIT TEN

KIT TENS MORE THAN FOUR
MONTHS OLD

• The kitten enters a dietary
transition period called weaning

• After the second teeth have
come through, the proportions
of the different nutrients
essential to the kitten’s growth
remain the same until your
cat is one year old (15 months
for Maine Coon kittens)

• The kitten gradually loses
its ability to digest lactose
and develops an increasing
intolerance to it
• During this particularly delicate
period, the kitten is susceptible
to digestive disorders
• The milk teeth erupt from
about two weeks to two months.
The kitten makes the transition
to solid food.
KIT TENS LESS THAN FOUR
MONTHS OLD

• From four to five weeks of age,
a kitten can be introduced to
solid food
• This food is first offered in the
form of gruel, prepared with
a little warm water or kitten
milk replacer
• The quantity of liquid will then
gradually be reduced until
your kitten is only being given
solid food
• Certain nutrients can
support the immune system
function of the young kitten

Nutrition

The kitten’s nutritional needs are specific during the first weeks
of life and will change as the kitten grows older. Royal Canin has
nutritional solutions to address the different stages of growth your
kitten will experience.

• The daily quantities of
food for growth will vary
and will be increased until
reaching adulthood
SPECIAL NEEDS OF THE
OLDER KIT TEN

• The kitten’s digestive ability
improves and begins to be able
to assimilate all nutrients
• As the adult teeth erupt, it's
important to help protect the
teeth from plaque and tartar
buildup. A crunchy kibble can
help create a brushing action
during each meal.
• The kitten’s bone structure
begins to consolidate and
muscle mass develops
• As growth rate slows,
a kitten’s energy
requirements, although
still high, decrease slightly

13

Nutrition for Adult Cats
Food for the kitten and for the adult cat must take into account change
as the kitten grows older. Complete and balanced foods are able to
guarantee the nutrition necessary for your cat’s well-being, whatever
age, breed or level of activity.
C AT S W I T H S E N S I T I V I T I E S

• Sensitivities of variable severity
at certain periods in a cat’s life are
due to a variety of factors: changes
in environment, diet, the seasons
or special features related to each
individual cat
• Digestive sensitivities may
lead to disorders like soft stools
– Highly digestible proteins limit
the concentration of residual
proteins in the intestinal tract
that sometimes aggravate
these conditions
– Nutrients like beet pulp and
fructooligosaccharides promote
a balanced intestinal flora
• Feline oral and dental sensitivities
can result in bad breath and the
buildup of plaque and tartar
– Daily brushing of your cat’s teeth
is the most effective solution,
but choosing a diet with dental
health benefits can also be a
convenient way to promote
oral hygiene
• Sensitive skin can result in dandruff,
a dull coat or other reactions
– Nutrition can help maintain
healthy skin and promote a
soft, glossy coat
• Cats may spend hours each day
grooming and tend to swallow hair,
which can form hairballs in the
stomach and intestines that are
difficult to get out
– Diets with specific fiber blends
can help control hairballs

• Within 48 hours of spaying or
neutering, kittens will eat more
and may experience rapid weight
gain, which can lead to obesity
and many other health concerns
• Monitoring food intake and
weight gain is very important
in both young and adult cats
• Consult your veterinarian
regarding ideal body weight
and condition for your cat
L O N G , H E A LT H Y L I V E S

• Cats can live up to 20-25 years
• The effects of aging may start
to be felt in the joints that have
been stressed throughout the
life of the cat
– A combination of glucosamine,
chondroitin and omega-3
fatty acids (EPA and DHA)
maintains healthy joint
function and helps to
preserve mobility
• Digestive, mobility, oral and
skin sensitivities can develop
at any point during a cat’s life

Behavior and Training
™

Behavior and Training

The essentials of your kitten’s education take place during the period
from birth to the age of six months. In fact, most behaviors are acquired
by the age of three months, thanks to the mother’s dominant role,
as well as siblings.
The kitten learns in two different ways: by imitating the mother’s actions,
and then learning by means of experimenting. If the kitten finds the
response pleasant, they tend to favor the action.
FAV O R A B L E E N V I R O N M E N T

U N FAV O R A B L E E N V I R O N M E N T

A favorable environment includes
surroundings where your kitten
socializes easily and becomes
familiar with people and the
surroundings. If the kitten has
been raised with the mother, it is
advisable for them to stay there
until weaned. Education will be
more complete, and your kitten
will transition more easily into
their new home.

If the environment in which the
kitten has developed is low in
stimuli, it is advisable to bring your
kitten into contact with other cats
at eight weeks old (provided the
other cat is fully vaccinated).

A kitten that has been handled by
several people from a very young
age will be more curious and open
to life. Similarly, familiarity with
different noises of everyday life
allows the kitten to be comfortable
in the new home environment.

The kitten needs to understand,
before the kitten’s weapons (claws
and teeth) are fully developed,
that there are boundaries.
The kitten needs to be socialized—
gentle handling by different
people, exposure to noises and
contact with other animals.

τ You are responsible
for your kitten’s
education and
socialization
τ Kittens need
a stimulating
environment
τ It may take longer
to train a kitten
that has not been
properly socialized

15

Your Kitten’s Home
To live in harmony, it is essential to understand the organization of
your kitten’s territory and basic activities. Once territory is defined,
your kitten will spend most of the time sleeping. When not sleeping, the
main occupations will be grooming, playing, hiding, eating and cuddling.

τ Avoid feeding your
kitten in the same
rooms where you eat
τ Kittens like to nap
near heat sources
τ The litter box should
be far away from the
kitten’s eating area

A cat’s territory is exclusive, and quality is more important than space.
Your kitten will identify your home as their territory. Inside your home,
the kitten organizes life around four key areas. You must respect this
organization without disturbing it, or you risk causing certain behavioral
problems in your kitten.
E AT I N G A R E A

LIT TER BOX

Keep the eating area away from
the litter box and avoid your
kitchen or your dining room,
so your kitten does not confuse
your plate with their dish.

From five to six weeks old, a
kitten will use the litter box, often
spending a lot of time covering the
stool. If this lesson has not been
learned, place the kitten in the
litter box. Dig a hole with the paw,
and then show the kitten how to
cover what has been excreted.
Repeat this exercise once or twice
and the kitten should start to do
this on their own.

P L AY A R E A

This is the biggest area and must
be conducive to playing, racing
about and climbing up high.
REST AREA

Your kitten prefers to rest in a
warm spot; a space near a safe
heat source (such as a sunny
window) is best.
Being close to you is always
important, so the kitten’s bed
should not be too far away
from your living area.

16

R O YA L C A N I N ® K I T T E N C A R E G U I D E

The litter box should be distant
from the food dish and your living
area. As a suggested rule, have one
more litter box than you have cats.

Your Kitten’s Activities
™

SLEEP

• Exercise is essential for your
kitten’s well-being

A kitten has two distinct
sleep phases:

• Exercise provides a means to
channel energy into positive
activity rather than using that
energy for destructive purposes

Deep Sleep
• Until eight weeks old, your
kitten is in a state of deep and
almost continual sleep in which
hormones essential to growth
are secreted

• Favorite exercises are those that
allow your kitten to climb, perch,
jump, sharpen the claws and
play with toys
P L AY

• Playing is a major part of the
kitten’s socialization
– Playing encourages
exploration of the
surroundings and develops
physical capabilities
• For the cat, playing and hunting
are two closely linked activities,
and a toy is often identified
as the prey
• Your kitten’s natural
hunting instinct may lead
to aggressive behavior
– If your kitten becomes
aggressive, stop playing with
them immediately and do
not play again until they have
calmed down

• At two months old, the continuity
of sleep decreases and your
kitten alternates between light
and deep sleep
Light Sleep
• From two months old, the sleep
rhythm will gradually change
towards that of the adult cat—
more than half a day on average,
split into several periods
throughout the day

Behavior and Training

E XERCISE

• During light sleep, your kitten
sleeps with one ear listening and
is attentive to the slightest noise
• Light sleep is generally followed
by a deep sleep, in which your
kitten is completely relaxed
IMPORTANT: You are advised never
to wake a kitten during deep sleep.

ROOSTING
– Y
 our kitten loves being up high—being at the

same height as your face makes them happy,
and they can rub against you, as with an equal

– If your home does not have enough places

that are high and safe, try to make some by
changing your surroundings a little or by
providing a cat tree

Your Kitten’s Personality
These tests are simple and will help you to become familiar with your
kitten’s personality.

τ Get to know your
kitten’s personality
through play
τ If your kitten is slow
to react, they may be

the kitten seeing you

Observe your kitten from
a distance

• If your kitten acts curious
while staying calm, they have
been brought up in a full and
stimulating environment

• A properly socialized kitten
will run to play or rub up
against you

• If the kitten runs away, they
must quickly be exposed to the
noises of everyday life so they
become accustomed to the
sounds of your household
ALUMINUM FOIL BALL TEST

Roll a ball of aluminum foil
in front of your kitten
• A slow reaction may
be expressing fear or
great indifference to
outside movement

and play with your kitten

Your Kitten’s Communication
™

FA C I A L E X P R E S S I O N S

• Your kitten is very sensitive
to your body language and
postures, though they cannot
understand your language,
apart from certain words

The shape of the eyes and the
position of the ears are accurate
indicators of what your kitten
wants to express.

• Cats can understand what
you are feeling (sorrow or joy)
and even anticipate what you
are going to do
• Your kitten is continually
communicating with you
through a full and explicit
body language of great variety
I M P O R TA N C E O F W H I S K E R S

Never cut the whiskers.
A cat uses them for the tactile
exploration of their surroundings,
and to communicate with
other animals.

Purring
Kittens start to purr when first feeding from their mother,
and it expresses huge satisfaction as well as total dependency.
By purring, your kitten is showing contentment.
Growling and Hissing
These are signs of intimidation and can be used in an attack.
Meowing
There is a wide variety of meows, each with its own meaning,

from the glands under the ears
against your ankles and showing
you that your kitten feels good
and includes you in their territory.
Rubbing Against You
When your kitten rubs its head or
tail against your legs, your pet is
happy. Your kitten feels good being
close to you and wants to share
their scent with you.
Kneading
A kitten is expressing intense
pleasure when they tread their
knees for long periods and is also
revisiting the joy of feeding from
their mother by using the same
push-pull movement as used
to stimulate the flow of milk.
The copied movement indicates
that the kitten is content.
Rolling on the Ground
When the kitten rolls on the
ground as soon as they see you,
they are showing submission.
This position is only assumed
with people with whom the kitten
is totally relaxed; this act of
submission is associated with
an earlier moment of relaxation.
Tail-Waving
When the kitten waves their tail,
your pet is expressing irritation.
If you are stroking your kitten
when the tail waving starts, stop
immediately. Your kitten is telling
you that they don’t like what
you’re doing.

TERRITORY MARKINGS

Your kitten’s habit of marking
territory is a natural behavior and
means of communication made
by depositing scents, hormonal
secretions or scratch marks.
Territorial marking is intended
to inspire fear and make any
intruder go away.
Scent Deposits
• Marking with urine
and/or feces is by far the
most common deposit
– Males primarily do this
in response to stress
(transport, intrusion of
another animal, etc.)
Hormonal Secretions
• Specific hormones known
as pheromones play a major
role in a kitten’s sexual and
territorial behavior
• The kitten marks a place another
animal has rubbed against in an
invitation to share territory and
as a sign of acceptance
Scratch Marks
• It is not known if the scratch
marks are possibly combined
with secretions coming from
glands next to the paw pads;
regardless, they mark territory
– Such markings, which may
also be a form of exercise, can
sometimes turn catastrophic
when the cat is afraid

Caring for Your Kitten
™

Health Care

The first visit to the veterinarian is not a simple consultation, but an
in-depth examination. This complete health check-up will confirm the
exact state of health of your new companion and will assure you there
are no hidden concerns.
In the event your kitten was given to you, this may be the first visit
and a time for the necessary vaccinations and checks. Your vet will
complete your kitten’s health record and will give you useful advice
on grooming and specific behaviors common to your pet’s breed.
Ask your veterinarian if you need to bring in a stool sample or any
paperwork from the purchase or adoption.
IMPORTANT: It is wise to obtain a written document from the seller
stating the purchase or adoption policy. This document could prove very
helpful in the event your veterinarian should discover a pre-existing
condition or genetic defect.

Care of Nose and Ears
CLE ANING YOUR KIT TEN’S E ARS

The basic rule is to touch the ears as little as possible. If there is an
obvious looking discharge, you need to consult your vet for a precise
diagnosis and a recommendation for the appropriate treatment and
ear solution.
IMPORTANT: When cleaning the ears, never use cotton swabs or
a water- or alcohol-based solution. Ask your veterinarian for an
appropriate cleaning solution.
CLE ANING YOUR KIT TEN’S NOSE

Some cats may have dry nasal secretions at the edges of the nostrils.
You can easily remove these with a warm, wet cotton ball or tissue.
IMPORTANT: Consult your vet if your kitten has a dry or snotty nose.

Permanent Identification
Cats may be identified by the insertion of a tiny microchip under
the skin. Microchipping your kitten will aid in identification in the event
they should get lost or be involved in a natural disaster. Veterinarians
insert microchips, which contain information on both the cat and
the owner.

τ Obtain a document
from the seller
regarding purchase
or adoption policy
τ The first vet
visit is the time
for vaccinations
and checks
τ Your vet can identify
health problems

Spaying or Neutering Your Kitten
These operations can be performed from the age of six months
(and sometimes even earlier) and protect kittens from unwanted
pregnancies or litters of kittens. Consult your vet for more information.

21

Disease Prevention
Vaccinations help prevent contagious and sometimes fatal diseases.
Some are mandatory, while others are only recommended, and may
vary according to the location, age, lifestyle and immune status of
the kitten or cat.
τ Vaccinations help
prevent the spread of
contagious diseases
τ Initial vaccinations
should begin between
six and nine weeks
τ Booster vaccinations
are necessary for
optimal protection
τ Schedule regular
veterinarian visits
for your kitten or cat

Vaccinations are most effective when they are given at fixed dates, with
booster vaccinations at specific times. The core feline vaccines include:
• Feline panleukopenia virus (FPV)

• Feline calicivirus (FCV)

• Feline herpes virus (FHV-1)

• Rabies virus (RV)

Depending on your cat’s environment and lifestyle, other vaccines may
be recommended by your veterinarian.
These vaccines are classified as noncore vaccines and are
recommended for those cats whose lifestyle places them at risk of
contracting the disease. An example of a noncore feline vaccine is:
• Feline leukemia virus (FeLV)
Generally speaking, kittens are vaccinated with FPV, FHV-1 and FCV
starting at six to nine weeks of age. For optimal immunity, these
vaccines should be administered at intervals of three to four weeks
until kittens are 16 weeks old. Cats are given booster vaccinations
as recommended by their veterinarian.
Rabies virus vaccines are usually administered between 12 and 16 weeks
of age as a single dose, with revaccination occurring one year later.
Adult revaccination may be annually or every three years, depending
on local and state statutes.

Parasite Prevention
™

PROTOZOA

Your kitten should receive regular
deworming treatments during
the initial vaccination series.
Your veterinarian can make specific
recommendations for routine
deworming based on your cat’s
lifestyle (indoor, outdoor, etc.).

Only your vet can identify these
parasites and prescribe the
appropriate treatment. There
are two microorganisms,
which mainly infect kittens:

Two types of worms are frequently
found in kittens:
Round Worms
• These worms lodge in the
kitten’s small intestine, where
they form balls and can cause
intestinal obstructions
• They can be detected by the
presence of eggs in the kitten’s
stool or on anal areas
Tapeworms
• Tapeworms fix onto the walls of
the intestine and cause bloating,
diarrhea and sometimes damage
to the coat

Giardia
Giardia fix onto the mucous
membrane of the small intestine,
causing diarrhea, incomplete
digestion and a gradual loss
of body weight

Health Care

WORMS

Coccidia
Coccidia are also parasites
of the digestive system
τ Kittens are more
susceptible to parasites
than adult cats
τ Your kitten should
receive regular
deworming treatments

• Their presence can be detected
in the stool; they look like grains
of rice
Your veterinarian is a resource
for treating these problems
if observed

23

Parasite Prevention
External Parasite Prevention
External parasites and infections found most commonly on kittens
are fleas, ringworm, ear mites and ticks.
FLEAS

• The prevention of fleas is a much
easier task than treatment
τ Flea prevention is
easier than treatment
τ Ringworm is a
fungal infection
τ If your kitten goes
outside, check
regularly for ticks

• Flea prevention involves using
either oral or topical medications
at regular intervals as
recommended by a veterinarian
• Prevention should be given
all year long but most
importantly during the spring
and summer months
• Kittens and adult cats can
be sensitive to many over-thecounter medications, some
of which may be very harmful
If your kitten already has fleas,
the cat and environment may need
to be treated in order to resolve
the problem.
Treatment of the environment
includes vacuuming or other
actions, as recommended by your
veterinarian; treatment of the kitten
may include topical medications to
kill fleas and oral medications to
treat parasites the fleas can carry.
Please seek veterinary advice
for proper medications and other
products for environmental care.
Do not use dog flea treatments
for cats.
E AR MITES

• This ear infection is caused
by mites living in the ear canal
• Usual signs of ear mites are the
presence of an abundant blackish
and waxy discharge and shaking
the head or rubbing the head
with the paw
24

R O YA L C A N I N ® K I T T E N C A R E G U I D E

• Treatment: follow your
veterinarian's advice
RINGWORM

• In spite of the name, ringworm
is not a worm, but a contagious
fungal infection, which affects
the skin
• It is resistant, widely spread
and contagious. It can
affect humans and almost
all animals
• Treatment is long and
complex, and you should
follow your veterinarian's
advice carefully
TICKS

• Ticks are picked up almost
exclusively outdoors
• If you have a cat that goes
outside, check regularly
for ticks
• Ticks prefer to attach
themselves around the neck
and ears and can cause
inflammatory reactions
where they are attached
• When removing a tick,
be very careful to remove
the tick’s head
For advice on removal and
prevention, please contact
your veterinarian.

HANDLING AND TR ANSPORTING

C H E C K I N G V I TA L S I G N S

• Don’t assume a cat won’t bite
or scratch

• Use rectal, not oral,
thermometers for cats.
Newer human digital
thermometers are best.

• Don’t try to comfort an injured
cat by hugging, and don’t put
your face near their head
• Wrap cat in a towel and always
use a carrier for transport
• Perform any examinations
slowly and gently; stop if the
cat becomes agitated
• Before transporting, try
to stabilize injuries—rolled
magazines or newspapers
can serve as impromptu
splints to immobilize joints

• Heart rate can be checked
by placing a hand over the
cat’s chest
• Respiration can be measured
by observing the flanks or
holding a wet finger in front
of the nostrils
• Measure both rates for
15 seconds, then multiply by
four to get the rate per minute
Normal Vital Signs

• Pad the injured limb and splint
generously with rolled cotton and
gauze, if available, or improvise
with pillows, towels, etc.

Heart Rate:
160–240 beats/minute
Respiration:
10–20 breaths/minute

Supplies for Your Kitten First-Aid Kit
τ Bandaging materials: gauze,
pads and rolls, rolled cotton

Taking Your Cat to the Vet
At Royal Canin, our philosophy is to put cats and dogs first. We know
that most cats do not receive regular veterinary care because many
cat owners are unaware of the need for annual visits. That is why
Royal Canin is partnering with our industry experts and influencers
to drive awareness of the need to take your cat to the vet.

DID YOU KNOW?
66% of cat owners would take their cat to the vet more
often if it was easier*
According to the American Association of Feline Practitioners, there are
several things cat owners can do to make visits to the veterinarian more
stress-free:
Understand your cat’s behavior.
The veterinarian’s office is
unfamiliar and has sights, sounds
and smells that can cause your
cat to feel anxious or fearful.
Cover their carrier with a
towel to help block the sight of
other animals and dampen the
unfamiliar sounds. Respect your
cat’s need for time to acclimate
to the new environment.
Get the best carrier for your
cat. Secure, stable, hard-sided
carriers that open from the top
and the front, and can also be
taken apart in the middle, are
best for your cat.

Help your cat become
comfortable with the carrier.
Place the carrier in a room at
home where your cat spends
most of their time and equip it
with familiar soft bedding and
special toys.
Take your cat to a cat-friendly
practice. These veterinary
practices have made specific
changes to decrease stress
and provide a more calming
environment for you and your cat.
Keep peace in a multi-cat
household. Leave the returning
cat in the carrier for a few minutes
to see how all of your cats react
to unfamiliar smells, and separate
if there are signs of tension.

*The 2017 Royal Canin survey of cat owners was conducted from June 26–27, 2016, with
2,009 participating cat owners. The survey was fielded using the Research Now online opt-in
consumer panel. At the time of the survey, participants were required to reside in the 50 states
or District of Columbia and be at least 18 years of age or older.
